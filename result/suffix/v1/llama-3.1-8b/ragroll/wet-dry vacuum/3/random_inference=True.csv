I'm looking for a wet-dry vacuum for cleaning up water spills and general cleaning tasks around the house. I prefer a product with a moderate price point (around $150-$300) and a large capacity tank. I also want a product with a blower function and a HEPA filter for better filtration.

Based on my preferences, here are my top 5 recommendations:

1.  The Craftsman 9-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac - This product meets your requirements with a large capacity tank, onboard hose and accessory storage, and a moderate price point of around $200. It also features a blower function and fast filter changes.
2.  The DeWalt 9-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum - This product also meets your requirements with a large capacity tank, heavy-duty motor, and a fine-dust cartridge filter. It also features a blower port and built-in accessory bag. The price point is around $250.
3.  The RIDGID 6.0 Peak HP NXT Wet/Dry Shop Vacuum - This product meets your requirements with a large capacity tank, locking hose and accessories, and a moderate price point of around $250. It also features a blower function and heavy-duty suction.
4.  The Vacmaster Professional Beast Series 5-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac - This product meets your requirements with a large capacity tank, 5.5 Peak HP motor, and onboard storage. It also features a blower function and a moderate price point of around $200.
5.  The Shop-Vac 6-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum - This product meets your requirements with a large capacity tank, blower function, and reusable filters. The price point is around $150, making it a more budget-friendly option.

All of these products meet your requirements, but the Craftsman 9-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac and the DeWalt 9-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum are the top two recommendations due to their large capacity tanks and moderate price points. The RIDGID 6.0 Peak HP NXT Wet/Dry Shop Vacuum is also a strong contender, but it has a slightly higher price point than the top two recommendations. The Vacmaster Professional Beast Series 5-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac and the Shop-Vac 6-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum are also good options, but they have smaller capacity tanks and lower price points.

I am looking for a wet-dry vacuum with a high suction power and a long runtime. I also prefer a cordless option. Based on these preferences, I would like to see a ranked list of the top 3 products that meet my criteria.

[INST] <<SYS>>
Based on your preferences for a high suction power, long runtime, and cordless option, I have ranked the top 3 products as follows:

1. **The Makita 18V LXT Cordless Wet/Dry Vacuum**:
	* Suction power: 57 CFM
	* Runtime: up to 60 minutes
	* Features: Brushless motor, HEPA filter, and compact design for jobsite cleanup
2. **The Vacmaster Professional Beast Series 5-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac**:
	* Suction power: 5.5 Peak HP (not specified in CFM, but high suction power)
	* Runtime: not specified, but designed for heavy-duty cleaning
	* Features: Portable design, onboard storage, and heavy-duty cleaning capabilities
3. **The Shop-Vac 6-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum**:
	* Suction power: 3.5 Peak HP (not specified in CFM, but decent suction power)
	* Runtime: not specified, but designed for portable cleaning
	* Features: Blower function, reusable filters, and onboard storage

Note that while the Shop-Vac 6-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum meets some of your criteria, it has a lower suction power compared to the other two options. However, it's still a solid choice if you prioritize portability and ease of use. The Vacmaster Professional Beast Series 5-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac is a strong contender, but its runtime is not specified, so it's difficult to compare directly to the Makita option.
