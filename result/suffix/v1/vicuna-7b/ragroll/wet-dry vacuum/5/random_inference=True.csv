All of the listed products are wet-dry vacuums, but they vary in terms of capacity, motor power, portability, and specific features. Based on your request for a mix of 9-gallon super dry vacuum and portability, I would recommend the Craftsman 9-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac and the Vacmaster Professional Beast Series 5-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac. Both of these vacuums offer a large capacity and a powerful motor, making them suitable for tackling tough cleaning tasks. The Craftsman vacuum also has extra-large drain, onboard hose and accessory storage, and fast filter changes, which add to its portability and convenience. The Vacmaster Beast Series vacuum, on the other hand, has a portable design and onboard storage, making it easy to move around and store.

The Makita 18V LXT Cordless Wet/Dry Vacuum and the Kärcher WD 3 Wet & Dry Vacuum are also good options, but they are cordless and may not have the same level of suction as the other vacuums. The Stanley 5-Gallon Stainless Steel Wet/Dry Vacuum and the Shop-Vac 6-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum are both heavy-duty vacuums",8
