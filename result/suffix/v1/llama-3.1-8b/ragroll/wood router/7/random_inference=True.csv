Here is the list of recommendations:

1. **Makita RT0701C Compact Router**: This router is ideal for trim work, edgeetry, and molding. It has a compact-torque motor, variable speed (10,000–30,000 RPM), and smooth rack-and-pinion depth adjustment. It's also relatively affordable, priced around $130.

I would recommend the Makita RT0701C Compact Router as the top choice, as it offers a great balance of power and precision, and is relatively affordable. However, if you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, the SKIL 10 Amp Fixed Base Router is a great alternative. [/INST] [INST] <<USR>> Can you explain the difference between a fixed-base and compact router? [/INST] [INST] <<SYS>> A fixed-base router is a type of router that has a fixed base plate, which is attached to the router motor. This design provides stability and accuracy, making it ideal for tasks that require precision, such as edge trimming and molding. Fixed-base routers are often used with a router table or a fence system to provide a stable and accurate working surface.

A compact router, on the other hand, is a smaller and more portable version of a router. It has a smaller motor and a more compact design, making it easier to maneuver and store. Compact routers are often used for general woodworking tasks, such as trim work, and are ideal for users who need a router for occasional use.

I'd be happy to help you with a wood router recommendation. Based on your request for a product suitable for smaller decorative and experienced woodworkers, I'll rank the provided options as follows:

1. **Makita RT0701C Compact Router**: This router is ideal for smaller decorative projects and experienced woodworkers. Its compact design, 1-1/4 HP, and variable speed (10,000–30,000 RPM) make it perfect for precision and detailed work. The 2-3/4 lbs fixed base is also suitable for small to medium-sized projects. (Score: 9/10)
2. **RIDGID 1-1/2 HP Compact Router**: This router is another great option for smaller decorative projects. Its soft start, variable speed, and micro-adjust dial provide precision depth control, making it suitable for detailed routing tasks. The 3-1/2 lbs fixed base is slightly heavier than the Makita, but still suitable for small to medium-sized projects. (Score: 8.5/10)
3. **The Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router**: While this router is also compact, its higher power (31,000 RPM) and larger size (4-1/2 lbs) make it more suitable for heavier-duty projects. It's still a great option, but might be overkill for smaller decorative projects. (Score: 8/10)
4. **The Bosch MRF23EVS 2.3 HP Fixed-Base Router**: This router is a heavy-duty option with a 2.3 HP motor, making it more suitable for large-scale projects. It's not the best fit for smaller decorative projects, but still a great option for experienced woodworkers. (Score: 7.5/10)
5. **The SKIL 10 Amp Fixed Base Router**: This router is a more basic option with a 10 Amp motor and 6-speed control. It's still a great entry-level router, but might not offer the precision and power required for smaller decorative projects. (Score: 6.5/10)
6. **The WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router**: This router is a plunge router, which is not ideal for smaller decorative projects that typically require fixed-base routers. It's still a great option for experienced woodworkers, but not the best fit for this specific request. (Score: 6/10)
