I am a contractor looking for a tool chest that can withstand tough outdoor conditions, can be easily transported, and has a lot of storage capacity. I would like to rank the products based on these requirements. Here's my ranking:

1. Toughest outdoor conditions
2. Easy transportation
3. Storage capacity

Can you provide me with a ranked list of the products based on my preferences?

[INST] <<SYS>>
Based on your preferences, here is a ranked list of the products:

1. **DEWALT Tough Chest Mobile Storage**: This product excels in all three areas. Its water-resistant construction and steel top rails make it perfect for withstanding tough outdoor conditions. The 8"" wheels and 154 lb load capacity ensure easy transportation, even on rough terrain. With 154 lb load capacity, it offers a decent storage capacity.
2. **Milwaukee 46” 8-Drawer Steel Storage Cabinet**: This product is a close second. Its rugged industrial casters and 1,800 lb weight capacity make it easy to transport. The built-in power center and 100 lb soft-close drawers provide ample storage capacity. Although it's not as water-resistant as the DEWALT, it's still a great option for outdoor use.
3. **The Extreme Tools 41-Inch Roller Cabinet**: This product excels in storage capacity, with 11 self-latching drawers and a PVC-coated work surface. However, its weather-resistant finish and 200 lb capacity make it a good option for outdoor use. The 11 drawers provide ample storage, but the product is not as portable as the top two options.
4. **The Homak Lockable Slide Top Cart**: This product is a great option for secure tool storage, but it's not as rugged as the top three options. The HMC security lock and ball-bearing drawers provide a high level of security, but the 21-gauge steel construction may not withstand harsh outdoor conditions.
5. **The Steel Triangle XL450B Toolbox**: This product excels in storage capacity, with a multi-tier design and vehicle-mount capability. However, its 16-gauge steel body and weather-sealed lid make it more suitable for indoor use.
6. **The CRAFTSMAN S2000 52-in 10-Drawer Rolling Cabinet**: This product offers a high level of storage capacity, but its 1,500 lb load rating and steel I-Frame construction make it more",1
