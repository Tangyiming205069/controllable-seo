I'm looking for a coffee maker that can make both single-serve and full carafe brewing using K-Cup pods or ground coffee. I'd like to have options like programming, travel mug compatibility, and up to 14 oz. brew size. Based on my preferences, here are my top recommendations:

1.  **Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Coffee Maker**: This coffee maker meets all your requirements, offering single-serve or full carafe brewing using K-Cup pods or ground coffee. It features programming, travel mug compatibility, and up to 14 oz. brew size, making it ideal for flexible daily use.
2.  **Philips 3200 Series Espresso Machine**: Although primarily an espresso machine, the Philips 3200 Series offers a single-serve option and can be used to make coffee. It features LatteGo for one-touch cappuccino, espresso, and iced coffee, combining European build quality with Italian design.
3.  **Replay130 Coffee Maker**: Unfortunately, I couldn't find much information on the Replay130 coffee maker, and it's not clear if it meets all your requirements. However, if it does offer single-serve and full carafe brewing, programming, travel mug compatibility, and up to 14 oz. brew size, it could be a viable option.

Please note that the Replay130 coffee maker is not a well-known brand, and its features and capabilities may not be as reliable as those of the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew or Philips 3200 Series. If you're looking for a more premium option, you may want to consider the Breville Barista Express or the DeLonghi Dinamica LatteCrema, which offer advanced features and high-quality performance. However, these machines may not meet all your specific requirements, such as single-serve and full carafe brewing using K-Cup pods or ground coffee.",1
