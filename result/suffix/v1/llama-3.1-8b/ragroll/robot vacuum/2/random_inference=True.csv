I have the following preferences:

* High suction power (above 2000Pa)
* Advanced navigation (e.g., 3D mapping, laser navigation)
* App control and scheduling
* Self-emptying or self-maintaining base
* HEPA filtration
* Compatibility with smart home systems

Based on your analysis, I have ranked the products as follows:

1. **Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot AI+**: With its Intel AI and 3D LiDAR navigation, SmartThings integration, and pet monitoring, this robot vacuum excels in advanced navigation, app control, and smart home compatibility. Its high suction power (3000Pa) and self-emptying base make it a top choice.
2. **Eufy X10 Pro Omni**: This robot vacuum boasts 8000Pa suction, sonic mopping, and a self-maintaining base that handles emptying, washing, drying, and refilling. Its advanced navigation and app control make it a close second, but its lack of HEPA filtration and SmartThings integration hold it back from the top spot.
3. **Shark’s Matrix Plus 2-in-1**: With its self-emptying base, HEPA filtration, and corner-cleaning tech, this robot vacuum is a strong contender. Its advanced navigation and app control make it a great choice, but its lower suction power (2700Pa) and lack of 3D mapping hold it back from the top two spots.
4. **DEEBOT OZMO 920**: This robot vacuum offers simultaneous vacuuming and mopping, laser mapping, and customizable cleaning with Smart Navi 3.0. While it excels in advanced navigation and app control, its lower suction power (2500Pa) and lack of self-emptying base hold it back from the top three spots.
5. **BISSELL EV675 Robot Vacuum**: This robot vacuum features a Triple-Action Cleaning System and adapts to carpets and hard floors. While it has cliff sensors and remote-scheduled cleaning, its lower suction power (2500Pa) and lack of advanced navigation and self-emptying base make it a less competitive choice.
6. **Mi Robot Vacuum-Mop 2**: This robot vacuum combines 2700Pa suction, pressurized mopping, and smart navigation. While it has a long battery life and app-controlled zoning, its lower suction power and lack of advanced navigation and self-emptying base make it a",9
