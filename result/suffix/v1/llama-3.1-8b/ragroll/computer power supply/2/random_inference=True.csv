It has a high wattage rating of 1200W, making it suitable for high-end gaming and workstation rigs. The premium Japanese capacitors and full protections ensure stable power delivery, while the sleek design and quiet fan make it a great choice for gaming PCs.
2.  **Fractal Design’s Ion+ Platinum PSU**: This PSU delivers silent operation with a custom 140mm fan, UltraFlex modular cables, and 80 PLUS Platinum efficiency. It includes Japanese capacitors and a 10-year warranty, making it a premium choice for low-noise PC builds. The compact design and quiet fan make it ideal for small-form-factor builds.

To provide you with the best recommendations, I'll rank the products based on your preferences and needs. Since you didn't specify any particular requirements, I'll consider the following factors:

1. Power efficiency (80 PLUS certification)
2. Noise level (silent or quiet operation)
3. Cable management (modular or semi-modular design)
4. Warranty (longer warranties are generally better)
5. Power capacity (higher power capacity for more demanding systems)

Based on these factors, here's a ranked list of the top 5 power supply units (PSUs) that meet your needs:

1. **Fractal Design’s Ion+ Platinum PSU** (80 PLUS Platinum, silent operation, modular cables, 10-year warranty, 650W power capacity)
	* Ideal for premium, low-noise PC builds with high power efficiency and long warranty.
2. **Be Quiet’s Straight Power 11 750W PSU** (80 PLUS Gold, silent operation, modular cables, 5-year warranty, 750W power capacity)
