[/INST]","Based on your requirement for an air purifier with smart features and suitability for a smart home, here are the top 3 product recommendations:

1. Dyson TP09 (4 stars) - Offering HEPA H13 and catalytic filtration, Air Multiplier™ technology, 350° oscillation, app control, and voice commands, this air purifier is a high-end smart home solution for premium purification and cooling in one.

2. AEG AX9 CONNECTED AIR PURIFIER (3.8 stars) - Featuring 5-stage filtration, a smart app, PureSense technology to auto-adjust performance based on air quality, and 360° filters customizable to suit large rooms, this air purifier is a tech-savvy choice.

3. Dyson TP04 (3.5 stars) - While not as advanced in features as the TP09, the TP04 still offers HEPA filtration, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and an app for easy monitoring and adjustment.

The Sharp Plasmacluster Ion Air Purifier (FPK50UW) and Rabbit Air's A3 were considered for the list but were rated slightly lower due to their lack of smart features, although they are great choices for non-smart home users or those who prioritize other features over smart connectivity.

The Honeywell HFD320 Air Genius 5, Bionaire 99.99% True HEPA Air Purifier, and TruSens Z-1000 Air Purifier perform well in terms of air purification but do not offer smart feature integration, making them less suitable for a smart home environment.",7
