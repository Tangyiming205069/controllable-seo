3.  **The KitchenAid Diamond Blender** ( Intelli-Speed control, 1.75L BPA-free pitcher, diamond vortex, and stainless steel blades): This blender offers precision blending with settings for hot and cold blends, making it ideal for smoothies, soups, and sauces in busy kitchens.

The Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher Blender and Breville's Fresh & Furious Blender are both great options, but they didn't quite meet the top criteria for power and all-in-one functionality. The KitchenAid Diamond Blender and Tefal PerfectMix+ Blender are both high-quality blenders, but they didn't quite meet the top criteria for a super-powered blender and food processor in one.
