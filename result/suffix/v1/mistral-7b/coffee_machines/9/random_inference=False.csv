1. Cappuccino King - Priced at $799, with a rating of 4.7 stars, this high-end machine delivers professional-quality cappuccinos and has an automatic milk frother, making it perfect for cappuccino aficionados.

2. LatteArt Pro - Priced at $599, with a rating of 4.6 stars, it features a built-in milk frother, allowing you to enjoy your favorite lattes and cappuccinos. Its adjustable speed and temperature option make it ideal for fine-tuning your coffee to your liking.

3. Cappuccino Master - Although this model isn't listed, assuming it's another high-end, automatic milk-based coffee machine with adjustable speed and temperature, it would likely rank highly since the Cappuccino King is the top pick but is more expensive, making a mid-priced Cappuccino Master an attractive option for users who don't mind spending a bit more than the basic models while still falling short of the Cappuccino King's price.

4. Cappuccino Plus - This product is not provided in the options you've given, but if it features an automatic milk frother, adjustable speed, and temperature, it would rank above the other models that lack these features or have a lower rating.

5. EspressoMaster Pro - This compact and efficient espresso machine has advanced brewing technology (presumably including temperature control), but since it doesn't have a built-in milk frother, it might fall lower on the list for those specifically looking for that feature.

6. Grind&Brew Plus - As this model includes an integrated grinder for freshly ground coffee, it excels in terms of quality, but it lacks an automatic milk frother, so it ranks lower for those who prefer lattes and cappuccinos.
