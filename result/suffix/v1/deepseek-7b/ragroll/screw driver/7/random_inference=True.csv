## 1. Introduction

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks with multiple layers. It has been widely used in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition tasks. In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in these areas. In this tutorial, we will explore the basics of deep learning, including the architecture of a neural network, activation functions, backpropagation, and optimization methods.

## 2. Neural Networks

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (or neurons) that process information and transmit it to other nodes. The nodes are arranged in layers, with each layer connected to the previous layer and the next layer. The output of each layer is calculated using a set of weights and biases, which are adjusted during training to improve the network's performance.

### 2.1. Layers in a Neural Network

There are three types of layers in a neural network:

* Input layer: The first layer of the network, which receives the input data.
* Hidden layers: Any layer between the input and output layers.
* Output layer: The final layer of the network, which produces the output.

### 2.2. Neurons in a Neural Network

Each neuron in a neural network has three parts:

* Input layer: The weighted sum of the input data, plus a bias term.
* Activation function: A nonlinear function that maps the weighted sum to a scalar value.
* Output: The result of the activation function.

The output of each neuron is passed through a non-linear activation function to produce an output value. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

## 3. Activation Functions

Activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the network, which allows it to learn more complex patterns. There are several types of activation functions, including:

* Sigmoid function: Maps the input value to a value between 0 and 1.
* ReLu function: Maps the input value to the maximum value, 0 or positive.
* Tanh function: Maps the input value to a value between -1 and 1.
* Softmax function: Maps the input values to probabilities, which",9
