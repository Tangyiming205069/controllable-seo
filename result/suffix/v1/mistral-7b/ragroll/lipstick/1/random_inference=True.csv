[/INST]","Based on your request for a long-lasting, cruelty-free, and comfortable matte lipstick, here are my top recommendations from the given products:

1. Revlon ColorStay Matte Lite Crayon - This lipstick is smudge-proof, water-resistant, and infused with mango seed oil for comfort. Its precise crayon design ensures a bold and comfortable wear.

2. L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Intense Volume Matte Lipstick - This lipstick offers a long-lasting, non-drying finish, and it boasts hyaluronic acid for hydrating and plumping benefits.

3. Maybelline Super Stay Matte Ink - With a no-transfer formula and up to 16 hours of wear, this lipstick provides intense matte color and a flawless finish. It is also free from animal testing, making it a cruelty-free option.

Alternatively, the Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick is another great option if you prefer a liquid lipstick formula. It is long-lasting, smudge-proof, and has a precise applicator. Keep in mind that while it is not vegan (as it contains beeswax), it is cruelty-free. Enjoy exploring these lipstick options, and I hope you find the perfect match!",4
