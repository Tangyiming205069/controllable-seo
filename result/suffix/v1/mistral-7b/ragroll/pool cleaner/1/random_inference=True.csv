Its leak-proof design and wall-climbing ability make it ideal for fully automated pool cleaning.  [/INST]","Given your preferences for a heavy-duty cleaner with float obstacle handling, light-button operation, and a relatively lightweight design, here are the top three recommendations for you:

1. The Polaris Vac-Sweep 280 pressure-side cleaner features double jets and a booster pump for powerful cleaning, captures debris with a dedicated filter bag, is easy to use with light button operation, and has a relatively lightweight design compared to many robotic pool cleaners. However, it requires a separate booster pump which may not be ideal for all setups.

2. The Aiper Scuba S1 Pro robotic cleaner delivers 100 GPM suction, dual PVC rollers, and a 5L filter basket, making it highly capable of handling heavy debris and float obstacles. It also offers three cleaning modes to suit various pool surfaces. The cleaner may be slightly heavier compared to some other options, but it features a user-friendly design with a single button for activation.

3. The Water Tech Pool Blaster Max Li is a cordless vacuum cleaner with powerful suction, a high-capacity debris chamber, and a 1-hour runtime, making it suitable for both in-ground and above-ground pools. Although it might not be as lightweight as some other options, the cordless design and easy-to-operate button make it easy to use, especially for one-handed operation while maneuvering around float obstacles. Keep in mind that while this model is great for spot cleaning or whole-pool cleaning without hoses or cords, it may not provide continuous cleaning like robotic pool cleaners do.",3
