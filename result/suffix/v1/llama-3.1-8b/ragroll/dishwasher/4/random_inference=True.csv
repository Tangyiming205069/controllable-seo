To provide you with the most accurate recommendations, I'll need to rank the products based on your specific preferences. Based on your request, I've identified the following key features and criteria:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: You're looking for products with ENERGY STAR certification.
2. **Money Savings**: You want to know which products can save you money.
3. **Environmental Impact**: You're interested in products that can help the environment.
4. **Ease of Use**: You've mentioned that ease of use is a 5.5 to 5 overall rating, which I'll interpret as a high priority for user-friendly features.
5. **Quiet Operation**: You're looking for products with quiet operation.

Based on these criteria, here are my top product recommendations:

1. **Haier’s ENERGY STAR Smart Dishwasher**:
	* ENERGY STAR certification
	* WiFi connectivity for smart control
	* Sanitize cycle
	* Stainless steel interior
	* Quiet operation (42 dBA)
	* Easy to use (4.5/5 rating)
	* Affordable price point
2. **Miele Dishwasher**:
	* ENERGY STAR certification
	* QuickIntenseWash for efficient cleaning
	* EcoPower tech for reduced water and energy use
	* ComfortClose door
	* FlexLine baskets and adjustable racks
	* Quiet operation (38 dBA)
	* Easy to use (4.5/5 rating)
	* Higher price point, but worth it for premium features
3. **Whirlpool Dishwasher**:
	* ENERGY STAR certification

I'll provide you with a ranked list of recommendations based on your request. Since you're looking for a practical and quick-to-use dishwasher for parents, I've considered factors such as ease of use, speed, and versatility. Here's the list:

1. **Whirlpool's dishwasher**: This model offers a 3rd rack, adjustable 2nd rack, and sensor cycle, making it ideal for busy families. The Sani Rinse, Quick Wash, and Soak & Clean options ensure fast and flexible cleaning.
2. **KitchenAid's dishwasher**: With its FreeFlex™ Third Rack and Advanced Clean Water Wash, this dishwasher provides flexible cleaning and a quiet performance of 44 dBA. The ProWash™ Cycle and fingerprint-resistant finish make it a great choice for households seeking spotless cleaning.
3. **Frigidaire’s Professional Series dishwasher**: This model combines powerful cleaning and sleek stainless steel styling, making it perfect for users seeking pro-grade performance in everyday kitchen use.
4. **The Maytag dishwasher**: Although it's a bit more expensive, the Maytag dishwasher features Dual Power Filtration and PowerBlast® cycle, making it ideal for tough loads and long-term reliability.
5. **The Avanti 24"" dishwasher**: This compact dishwasher is ideal for small spaces, but it may not offer the same level of features and performance as the other options on this list.

I've ranked the Haier’s ENERGY STAR® Smart Dishwasher and Fisher Paykel’s Double DishDrawer™ dishwasher lower on the list, as they may require more setup and maintenance due to their smart features and independent drawer operation. The Miele dishwasher is also a great option, but its higher price point and more complex features may not be suitable for parents seeking a practical and quick-to-use dishwasher.
