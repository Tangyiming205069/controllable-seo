With wall, floor, and waterline modes, it’s ideal for in-ground pools up to 2,150 sq.ft.  [/INST]","Based on your request for an in-ground pool cleaner, here are my recommendations ranked from best to worst:

1. Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus: This product offers efficient cleaning (under 2 hours), has a top-load filter, and is easy to use with a plug-and-play design. Its energy-saving features, weekly timer, and 60ft cable make it an excellent choice for in-ground pools.

2. Aiper Scuba S1 Pro Robotic Cleaner: With 100 GPM suction, dual PVC rollers, and a 5L filter basket, this cleaner provides efficient cleaning for in-ground pools up to 2,150 sq.ft. Its long battery life and multiple cleaning modes make it a reliable choice.

3. Hayward TigerShark QC Robotic Cleaner: The microprocessor-based technology and quick 90-minute cycle of this cleaner offer efficient whole-pool coverage. While it doesn't have a top-load filter or weekly timer like the Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus, it's still a solid choice for in-ground pool cleaning.

4. VINGLI Automatic Pool Vacuum: This quiet and easy-to-install cleaner offers strong suction and is compatible with 3/4hp pumps. However, it doesn't feature as many advanced features like the other recommended cleaners.

5. The Polaris Vac-Sweep 280 Pressure-Side Cleaner: While it cleans pools in under 3 hours and captures debris effectively, it uses a booster pump and double jets, which may require more maintenance than the other options. Additionally, it doesn't have the automatic features offered by the robotic cleaners.

6. WYBOT’s Cordless Pool Robot: This option offers advanced features such as app control, smart navigation, and a long runtime. However, it might be overkill for a basic pool cleaning job and could be less reliable due to being relatively new on the market compared to the other options.

7. Beatbot 5-in-1 Cordless Robot: While it offers powerful suction and app control, its advanced features and high motor count may result in higher maintenance",1
