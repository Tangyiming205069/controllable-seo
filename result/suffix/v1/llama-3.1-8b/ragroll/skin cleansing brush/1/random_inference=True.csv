Based on your request for a waterproof and silent usage skin cleansing brush, I recommend the following products in order of preference:

1. **Liberex Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush**: This product meets both your requirements, being waterproof (IPX7) and silent in operation. It features ultra-soft silicone, induction charging, and 200 uses per full charge, making it a great option for deep pore cleansing and skin care.
2. **The Braun FaceSpa 851V**: Although not explicitly mentioned as silent, this product is waterproof and features a micro-oscillation brush action that is relatively quiet compared to other options. It's a 3-in-1 system that provides facial epilation, cleansing, and massage.
3. **The Beurer Facial Cleansing Brush**: This product is also waterproof and suitable for sensitive skin types. However, it's not explicitly mentioned as silent, and its rotating brush heads may produce some noise during use.

I have removed the other products from the list as they do not meet your specific requirements. The Vanity Planet Aira Facial Steamer, for example, is not a cleansing brush, and the other products do not have the necessary features you requested.

Based on your request, here are the top 5 product recommendations for a skin cleansing brush, ranked according to your preferences:

1. **The FOREO LUNA 3**: This 2-in-1 cleansing and firming solution is clinically proven to remove 99.5% of impurities and enhance skincare absorption. Its ultra-hygienic silicone and customizable T-Sonic pulsations make it an excellent choice for maintaining glowing skin.
2. **The Liberex Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush**: This brush features ultra-soft silicone, IPX7 waterproofing, induction charging, and 200 uses per full charge. It's perfect for deep pore cleansing, collagen boosting, and wrinkle reduction on all skin types.
3. **The Soniclear Elite by Michael Todd**: This sonic-powered face and body cleansing brush provides dermatologist-recommended results, improving fine lines, rough patches, and skin health across all skin types.

I've ranked the products based on their effectiveness, ease of use, and suitability for maintaining glowing skin. The FOREO LUNA 3 stands out for its clinically proven results and customizable features, making it the top recommendation. However, the Beurer Facial Cleansing Brush is a close second, offering deep cleansing and gentle exfoliation suitable for sensitive skin types. The Braun FaceSpa 851V, while a great product, is not a traditional skin cleansing brush and is ranked lower due to its additional features and higher price point. The Vanity Planet Aira Facial Steamer and The Shiseido Cleansing Massage Brush are also great products, but they don't quite fit the traditional skin cleansing brush category, so they're ranked lower in the list. The Soniclear Elite by Michael Todd and The Mary Kay Skinvigorate Sonic Skin Care System are great options, but they're ranked lower due to their slightly lower effectiveness and ease of use compared to the top 3 recommendations.

Based on your request, I've ranked the products according to your preference for a skin cleansing brush. Here's the top 5 recommendations:

1. **Beurer Facial Cleansing Brush**: This product is ideal for deep cleansing, removing up to 6x more dirt and pollutants than hand washing. Its rotating brush heads are suitable for sensitive skin types and thorough makeup removal, making it perfect for daily facial care.
2. **The Shiseido Cleansing Massage Brush**: This product offers gentle facial massage, promoting microcirculation and skin vitality across all skin types. Its silky-soft, tapered bristles and silicone cushions make it an excellent choice for those seeking a gentle yet effective cleansing experience.
3. **The FOREO LUNA 3**: This 2-in-1 cleansing and firming solution provides ultra-hygienic silicone and customizable T-Sonic pulsations, clinically proven to remove 99.5% of impurities and enhance skincare absorption for all skin types.
4. **The Mary Kay Skinvigorate Sonic Skin Care System**: This product offers 60-second sonic cleansing at three speeds, removing up to 4x more dirt and pollutants than hand cleansing. It's suitable for daily use on all skin types, making it a great option for those seeking a convenient and effective cleansing solution.
5. **The Liberex Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush**: This product features ultra-soft silicone, IPX7 waterproofing, induction charging, and 200 uses per full charge. It's perfect for deep pore cleansing, collagen boosting, and wrinkle reduction on all skin types, but may not be as effective as the top 4 recommendations for deep cleansing.

The other products, while great in their own right, didn't quite make the top 5 for a skin cleansing brush. The Vanity Planet Aira Facial Steamer is a great product for detoxifying pores and boosting circulation, but it's not a traditional cleansing brush. The Braun FaceSpa 851V is a 3-in-1 system that's more focused on epilation and massage, and the Soniclear Elite by Michael Todd is a more general-purpose sonic-powered face and body cleansing device.
