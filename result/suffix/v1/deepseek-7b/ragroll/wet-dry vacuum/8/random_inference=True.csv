首先，请确保你的`config.toml`文件位于`src/config`目录下。以下是一个简单的配置示例：

```
[database]
  type = ""mysql""
  host = ""localhost""
  user = ""root""
  password = ""password""
  database = ""my_database""

[logging]
  level = ""info""

[server]
  host = ""0.0.0.0""
  port = 3000
  secret_key = ""secret_key""
```

在这段配置代码中：

1. `database`部分指定了数据库类型（`mysql`），以及数据库主机、用户名、密码和数据库名。
2. `logging`部分指定了日志记录的级别（`info`）。
3. `server`部分指定了应用程序监听的地址和端口（`0.0.0.0`和`3000`），以及一个用于会话管理的安全密钥（`secret_key`）。

在运行应用程序之前，请确保已经安装了必要的依赖，比如`mysql`和`flask`。你可能需要安装它们，例如：

```
pip install flask mysql-connector-python
```

最后，你可以通过运行`flask init`命令来初始化应用程序的结构，这将生成`app.py`、`config.py`、`templates`和`static`目录。",9
