I am looking for a pool cleaner that can handle large pools with a lot of debris. I am willing to spend up to $1,500. My pool is 3,000 sq. ft. in-ground pool with a lot of trees surrounding it, so it needs to be able to handle a lot of leaves and debris. I also want a cleaner that can clean the walls and waterline of my pool.

Here is my ranked list of recommendations:

1.  The Aiper Scuba S1 Pro robotic cleaner is not suitable for a pool of your size, but the WYBOT cordless pool robot could be a good option for you. It has a 200-minute runtime and can handle large pools with its triple motors and smart navigation. It's also leak-proof and can climb walls, making it a great option for your pool.
2.  The Hayward TigerShark QC robotic cleaner is another good option for you. It has a 90-minute cycle and can handle large pools with its microprocessor-based technology. It also has a cartridge filter and can clean the walls and waterline of your pool.
3.  The Polaris Vac-Sweep 280 pressure-side cleaner is a good option for you, but it may require more maintenance than the other two options. It uses a booster pump to clean the pool and captures debris in a dedicated filter bag, extending filter life.
4.  The Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus is a good option for you, but it may not be able to handle the amount of debris in your pool. It cleans pool floors and walls in under 2 hours and has a top-load filter, but it may require more frequent cleaning due to the large amount of debris in your pool.
5.  The VINGLI automatic pool vacuum is not a good option for you, as it is designed for smaller pools and may not be able to handle the size of your pool.
6.  The Water Tech Pool Blaster Max Li is not a good option for you, as it is a handheld vacuum and may not be able to handle the size of your pool or the amount of debris in it.
7.  The Beatbot 5-in-1 cordless robot is not a good option for you, as it is a more expensive option and may not be able to handle the size of your pool or the amount of debris in it.

I hope this helps you make an informed decision about which pool cleaner to choose!",7

Based on your request for a product recommendation for a medium-sized pool, I've ranked the products as follows:

5. **The Hayward TigerShark QC robotic cleaner**: This cleaner is designed for automatic whole-pool coverage, but its 90-minute cycle might not be sufficient for a medium-sized pool.
6. **The Beatbot 5-in-1 cordless robot**: Although it's a great option for larger pools, its 9 motors and 5500 GPH suction power might be overkill for a medium-sized pool.

2. **Aiper Scuba S1 Pro Robotic Cleaner**: This product offers impressive suction power of 100 GPM, along with dual PVC rollers and a 5L filter basket. Its wall, floor, and waterline modes cater to different pool cleaning needs, and the 180-minute battery life ensures extended cleaning sessions. Suitable for in-ground pools up to 2,150 sq.ft., it's a close second in terms of performance and versatility.

3. **Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus**: This product is a hassle-free in-ground pool cleaning solution with a top-load filter and plug-and-play design. Its 60ft cable and energy-saving features make it a convenient option.

4. **The Hayward TigerShark QC Robotic Cleaner**: This product is efficient with its Quick Clean 90-minute cycle and microprocessor-based technology. However, its lack of external pumps or hoses might limit its adaptability to different pool types and sizes. It's still a reliable option for automatic whole-pool coverage.

5. **The Beatbot 5-in-1 Cordless Robot**: While this product offers a range of features, including 9 motors and 5500 GPH suction, its high price point and complex features might make it less appealing to users seeking a straightforward pool cleaning solution. It's a good option for those willing to invest in advanced technology.

6. **The Polaris Vac-Sweep 280 Pressure-Side Cleaner**: This product is a good option for in-ground pools, capturing debris in a dedicated filter bag and extending filter life. However, its need for external pumps and hoses might make it less convenient than other options. It's still a reliable choice for those who prefer a more traditional pool cleaning approach.

7. **The Water Tech Pool Blaster Max Li**: This product is a good spot or whole-pool cleaning solution",7

1.  **Water Tech Pool Blaster Max Li**: This cordless rechargeable vacuum meets all your requirements, weighing only 7.4 lbs and featuring a quick charge LED10-v quick charge feature. It's also backed by a competitive warranty and has a high-capacity debris chamber.
