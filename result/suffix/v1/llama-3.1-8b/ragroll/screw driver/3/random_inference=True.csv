I'm looking for a screwdriver that is compact, lightweight, and suitable for professionals who need high-precision fastening. I'd like to prioritize the products based on their precision, durability, and ease of use.

Here are my preferences:

1. Precision: High (ability to adjust or preset torque)
2. Durability: High (ability to withstand heavy use and harsh environments)
3. Ease of use: High (quick-release chucks, ergonomic design, etc.)

Rank the products based on these preferences and provide a numbered list of the top 3 recommendations.

[INST] <<SYS>>
Based on your preferences, here's a ranked list of the top 3 screwdriver recommendations:

1.  **Wera’s Kraftform Torque Screwdrivers**: This product excels in all three areas, offering high-precision fastening with adjustable and preset torque (0.1–8.8 Nm), quick-release chucks, and excess-load feedback. Its ergonomic design and high-quality materials ensure durability and ease of use.
2.  **DEWALT DCF680N1 8V MAX Gyroscopic Screwdriver**: This product offers high precision with motion-activated variable speed and a 2-position handle. Its compact design and lightweight build make it easy to use, and the LED light provides excellent visibility. Although it may not offer the same level of torque adjustment as the Wera, its precision and ease of use make it a close second.
3.  **Bosch GO Professional Cordless Screwdriver**: This product provides high precision with 5 torque settings and electronic brake. Its compact and USB-chargeable design make it easy to use, and the dual-activation feature offers flexibility. While it may not offer the same level of durability as the Wera or the DEWALT, its high-quality materials and ergonomic design ensure a comfortable user experience.

These three products are the top recommendations based on your preferences. However, if you're looking for a more affordable option, the Bosch GO Professional Cordless Screwdriver may be a better choice. If you prioritize durability above all else, the Wera's Kraftform Torque Screwdrivers would be the best option. [INST] <<USR>>

What do you recommend?[/INST] [INST] <<SYS>> Based on your request, I recommend the following top 3 screwdrivers for professional use and high precision:

It's a great tool for plumbers and DIYers, but it doesn't fit the criteria you specified for a screwdriver. I should not have included it in the initial recommendation list.

Based on your request, I've ranked the product recommendations according to your preference for a long-lasting tool driver with a vast set. Here's the top two recommendations:

The RIDGID EZ Change Faucet Tool and MEGAPRO 13-in-1 Automotive Ratcheting Screwdriver were not included in the top 5 list as they don't directly align with the user's specified requirements. The RIDGID tool is primarily designed for plumbing and faucet installations, while the MEGAPRO tool is geared towards automotive applications.

The CRAFTSMAN 6-piece Jewelers Screwdriver Set was not considered due to its focus on delicate repairs and electronics work, which doesn't match the user's primary needs in heavy industries and warehouses. Fantasy Gal was not a product in the original list, so it was not considered for the recommendations. [",1
