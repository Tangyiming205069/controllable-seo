To provide the best recommendations for you, I'll need to consider your preferences and needs. Please answer the following questions:

1. What is your budget for the electric toothbrush?
2. Are you looking for a specific feature (e.g., flossing, whitening, travel-friendliness)?
3. Do you have any dental concerns or preferences (e.g., gum health, sensitive teeth)?
4. How often do you plan to use the toothbrush?

Please answer these questions, and I'll provide a ranked list of product recommendations tailored to your needs. [/INST] <<USR>>
I have a budget of $100. I am looking for a toothbrush with a pressure sensor and a 2-minute timer. I have sensitive teeth and gums. I plan to use it daily. [/USR] <<SYS>>
Based on your preferences, here's a ranked list of product recommendations:

1. **The Oral-B Pro 1000**: This toothbrush meets all your requirements, including a pressure sensor and 2-minute timer. It's also dentist-recommended and has 3 modes for gentle cleaning. ($60)
2. **The Colgate hum smart toothbrush**: This toothbrush features personalized brushing guidance via app, 3 sonic modes, and a 2-minute timer. It also has a soft replaceable head and an ergonomic grip, making it suitable for sensitive teeth and gums. ($50)
3. **The Quip electric toothbrush**: While it doesn't have a pressure sensor, Quip's slim design and 3-month battery make it a great option for daily use. It's also ADA-accepted and refillable with eco-friendly options. ($40)
4. **The Sonic-FX Solo**: This toothbrush delivers 40,000 strokes per minute with 3 brushing modes and a 2-minute timer. However, it's a bit more expensive than the other options, and its interdental brush might be more than you need. ($80)

I've excluded the following products from the list:

* The BURST Pro Sonic Toothbrush, which is a bit more expensive than your budget and doesn't have a pressure sensor.
* The FOREO ISSA mikro, which is designed for babies and might be too gentle for your needs.
* The Waterpik Sonic-Fusion 2.0, which is an all-in-one flossing and sonic toothbrush that's a bit more expensive than your budget.
