Based on the user's request, I have ranked the products according to their adjustability, specifically the adjust1 tank. However, I notice that there is no product with an ""adjust1 tank"" feature. Therefore, I will rank the products based on their tank capacity and adjustability features.

Here is the revised list:

1. **The Ingersoll Rand SS5L5 Single Stage Air Compressor**: Features a 60-gallon vertical tank, which is the largest tank capacity among the listed products. While it doesn't have an ""adjust1 tank"" feature, its durable cast-iron construction and 2-year warranty make it a top choice for serious DIYers and professionals.
2. **The Quincy QGS Rotary Screw Air Compressor**: Offers a range of tank sizes from 5 to 100 hp, making it a versatile option for various applications. Although it doesn't have an ""adjust1 tank"" feature, its quiet operation and low oil carryover make it suitable for continuous-duty use in industrial and manufacturing sectors.
3. **The Porter-Cable 6 Gallon Oil Free Pancake Compressor**: Features a lightweight 30 lb pancake-style tank, which is easy to transport and maintain. While it doesn't have an ""adjust1 tank"" feature, its oil-free pump and compact design make it ideal for DIYers and home workshop users.
