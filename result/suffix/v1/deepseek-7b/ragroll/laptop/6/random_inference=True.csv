The best place to learn how to trade stocks and options is through a combination of self-study and mentorship. 

1. Self-study: You can start by reading books and online resources to learn the basics of stock and option trading. Some recommended books include ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham, ""Options as a Strategic Investment"" by John J. Murphy, and ""Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard"" by Michael W. Covel.

2. Online courses: Many online platforms offer courses on stock and option trading. Websites like Udemy, Coursera, and edX offer a wide range of courses on trading. 

3. Mentorship: Seeking guidance from experienced traders can be extremely beneficial. Look for experienced traders who are willing to share their knowledge and experience through mentorship programs or by joining online trading communities. 

4. Trading simulator: Practicing trading with a virtual trading account can help you gain experience and confidence before you start trading with real money. Platforms like StockTradeSim, ThinkOrSwim, and TradeStation offer virtual trading accounts.

5. Real-time trading: After gaining some experience, you can start trading with real money. However, it is important to start small and gradually increase your trading size as you gain more experience and confidence.

6. Stay updated: The stock and option market is constantly evolving, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest market trends, news, and strategies.

7. Be patient and disciplined: Trading can be a challenging and emotional journey. Developing patience, discipline, and a well-defined trading plan is crucial to success in trading.

Remember, trading stocks and options involves risk, and you should only invest money that you can afford to lose. Always do your research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.",9
