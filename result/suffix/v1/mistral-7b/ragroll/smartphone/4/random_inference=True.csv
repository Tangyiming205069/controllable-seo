[/INST]","Based on your request for a high-end smartphone with exceptional performance and video capabilities, here are my top recommendations ranked in order:

2. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 - While not specifically marketed for video capabilities, the Z Fold3 offers a flexible form factor that can provide unique video viewing experiences.
