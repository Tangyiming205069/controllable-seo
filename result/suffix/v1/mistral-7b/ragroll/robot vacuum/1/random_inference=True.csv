1. **BISSELL EV675 Robot Vacuum** - This vacuum is ideal for pet owners as it adapts to carpets and hard floors, has cliff sensors, and features a Triple-Action Cleaning System that includes dual edge brushes and strong suction. Its 100-minute runtime ensures it gets the job done, even in larger areas where pets tend to make a mess.

Its slim design allows it to reach under furniture where pet hair might accumulate, but its features might be considered less advanced compared to other top-tier models.

5. **Mi Robot Vacuum-Mop 2** - This vacuum offers 2700Pa suction and pressurized mopping, which can help tackle pet messes, but it might not be as specialized as other options for pets due to the lack of specific features like cliff sensors or deep carpet cleaning technology.
