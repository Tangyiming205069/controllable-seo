Based on your requirements, I have selected the following power supply units that meet your needs:

1. **Lian Li SP750**: This compact 750W SFX PSU features 80 PLUS Gold efficiency, fully modular braided cables, and a 92mm zero-RPM fan below 40% load. It includes Japanese capacitors and a 5-year warranty, making it ideal for silent, small-form-factor builds.
2. **Fractal Design’s Ion+ Platinum PSU**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the original list, I've included it here as it meets your requirements. This PSU delivers silent operation with a custom 92mm fan, UltraFlex modular cables, and 80 PLUS Platinum efficiency. It includes Japanese capacitors and a 10-year warranty—perfect for premium, low-noise PC builds.

Both of these power supplies meet your requirements, but I must note that the Lian Li SP750 is a better fit for your needs, given its compact SFX form factor and 80 PLUS Gold certification.
