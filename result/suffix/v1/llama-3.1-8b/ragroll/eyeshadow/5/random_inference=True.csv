To provide the best recommendations for you, I'll analyze the products based on your request. Since you're looking for an eyeshadow, I'll consider the following factors:

1. **Pigmentation**: How well does the eyeshadow apply and how vibrant is the color?
2. **Ease of use**: How easy is it to apply and blend the eyeshadow?
3. **Longevity**: How long does the eyeshadow stay in place without fading or creasing?
4. **Customization**: How versatile is the eyeshadow palette, allowing you to create different looks?

Based on these factors, here are my top recommendations:

1. **Pat McGrath Labs Mothership Eye Palettes**:
	* Pigmentation: 9.5/10 (high-saturation shadows with rich color payoff)
	* Ease of use: 9/10 (creamy, blendable formula for smooth application)
	* Longevity: 9/10 (long-lasting, waterproof formula)
	* Customization: 9.5/10 (20 shades for bold, customizable artistry)
2. **Too Faced's Chocolate-Infused Eyeshadow Palette**:
	* Pigmentation: 9/10 (silky, cocoa-scented shades with rich pigments)
	* Ease of use: 8.5/10 (smooth application, but may require more blending)
	* Longevity: 8.5/10 (long-lasting, but may require touch-ups)
	* Customization: 8/10 (18 shades for creating bold or natural eye looks)
3. **NARS' Orgasm Eyeshadow Palette**:
	* Pigmentation: 9/10 (liquid-binding system for high-impact color)
	* Ease of use: 9/10 (smooth application, easy to blend)
