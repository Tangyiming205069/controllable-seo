1. Quip electric toothbrush: This eco-friendly toothbrush features timed sonic vibrations and a slim, travel-friendly design, making it perfect for minimalists who value form, function, and sustainability.

2. Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Smart 9500: While not explicitly eco-focused, this toothbrush removes up to 10x more plaque, improves gum health in 2 weeks, and offers app-guided feedback. Plus, it comes with 4 brush heads, which can help reduce overall waste compared to single-use heads.

3. The Colgate hum smart toothbrush: Although not eco-focused in its design, this smart toothbrush delivers personalized brushing guidance via app, which can help users adopt more efficient brushing habits, potentially reducing the need for dental appointments and associated waste.

For a more eco-friendly and high-powered option, I'd recommend the Waterpik Sonic-Fusion 2.0, which combines brushing and water flossing in one tool. However, this toothbrush uses disposable brush heads.

For a more direct eco-friendly electric toothbrush option, you might want to consider looking beyond this provided list. Check out brands like Biolage, Vagabond or Bite-Away (which uses a refillable head and plant-derived bristles) if you're interested in a toothbrush with greater eco-credentials.",1

2. Colgate hum smart toothbrush: This toothbrush delivers personalized brushing guidance via app, 3 sonic modes, a 2-minute timer, and an ergonomic grip. The soft replaceable head and ADA-accepted design make it a great choice for those seeking smarter brushing.
