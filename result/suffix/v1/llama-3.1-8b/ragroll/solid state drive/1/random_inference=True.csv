Can you explain the difference between SATA III and PCIe Gen3x4? 

[INST] <<SYS>>
SATA III and PCIe Gen3x4 are two different interfaces used to connect storage devices to a computer.

**SATA III**:
SATA III is a serial interface that connects storage devices to a computer's motherboard. It's a widely used interface for traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). SATA III offers speeds of up to 600MB/s, which is sufficient for general use, such as storing files, running",3
