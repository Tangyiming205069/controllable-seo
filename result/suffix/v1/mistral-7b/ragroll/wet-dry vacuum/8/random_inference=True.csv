[/INST]","Based on your request for a wet-dry vacuum, here are my top two recommendations from the given list:

1. DeWalt 9-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum: This vacuum features a heavy-duty motor, fine-dust cartridge filter, 10 ft cord, blower port, and built-in accessory bag, making it suitable for tough jobsite cleaning tasks.

2. Makita 18V LXT Cordless Wet/Dry Vacuum: This vacuum offers a brushless motor, HEPA filter, 57 CFM suction, and 60 minutes runtime, providing compact, portable, and durable performance for jobsite cleanup. Additionally, it is cordless, which may be beneficial for your specific needs if you require a vacuum that's not limited by a power cord.

As for extractors with 5 micron HEPA filters and 5 horsepower, I'm afraid the provided product list does not include any that meet both criteria. However, I'd like to suggest the Ridgid 6.0 Peak HP NXT Wet/Dry Shop Vacuum as an alternative that has a powerful motor and high-quality filtration, and it's perfect for heavy-duty cleanup in workshops, garages, and homes. The Whisper Wet/Dry Shop Vacuum by Shop-Vac, model number not specified, could be another option, but I'm unable to confirm its exact specifications at this time. I recommend researching these models further to determine if they meet your specific requirements for a 5 micron HEPA filter and 5 horsepower.

Regarding the request for an extractor perfect for a chop saw, I would suggest a vacuum with a dust collection port or a tool-specific attachment designed for capturing sawdust and debris, such as the Ridgid 6.0 Peak HP NXT Wet/Dry Shop Vacuum mentioned above, featuring a flexible hose and accessories that should suit your needs.",9

Unfortunately, I could not find any extractors with 5 micron horsepower as you mentioned. The horsepower for vacuums is a measurement of the motor's power, not the vacuum's ability to extract particles in microns. If you're looking for a specific product with the 'whisper' or 'home' brand, I'd recommend checking out their product catalog for the most accurate recommendations.

For the RIDGID 6.0 Peak HP NXT Wet/Dry Shop Vacuum, while it doesn't have 5 micron horsepower, it delivers powerful suction with locking hose and accessories, designed for heavy-duty cleanup in workshops, garages, and homes.",9
