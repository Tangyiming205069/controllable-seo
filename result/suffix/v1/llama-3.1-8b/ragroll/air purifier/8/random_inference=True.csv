I'd like to get some product recommendations for an air purifier that is suitable for a large space (around 400 sq. ft.). I'd like the air purifier to have a high-quality filter, be quiet, and have smart features such as app control and voice commands. I'd like the product to be energy efficient and have a sleek design.

Based on your analysis, I recommend the following products in order of priority:

1.  **Dyson TP09**: This air purifier has a high-quality HEPA H13 filter that captures 99.95% of ultrafine particles and destroys formaldehyde. It also features Air Multiplier tech, 350° oscillation, app control, and voice commands, making it an excellent choice for smart home users.

I am looking for a high-end unit that can relieve allergy symptoms and also control temperature. Based on the provided list, here are my top recommendations:

1.  **Dyson TP09**: This premium air purifier is a high-end unit that can relieve allergy symptoms and also control temperature. It features HEPA H13 and catalytic filters to remove 99.95% of ultrafine particles and destroy formaldehyde. With Air Multiplier™ tech, 350° oscillation, app control, and voice commands, it's ideal for smart home users wanting premium purification and cooling in one.
2.  **IQAir GC MultiGas**: This premium air purifier is designed for advanced gas and odor removal, utilizing medical-grade filtration for allergens and VOCs. Ideal for chemically sensitive users or those in need of high-efficiency filtration in large spaces. Although it doesn't have temperature control, it's a high-end unit that can relieve allergy symptoms.

Both of these units are high-end and can relieve allergy symptoms, but the Dyson TP09 has the added feature of temperature control, making it a more comprehensive solution for users who want to address both air quality and temperature in their space. However, if you prioritize temperature control and are willing to compromise on the additional features of the Dyson TP09, the IQAir GC MultiGas is a solid choice.",1
