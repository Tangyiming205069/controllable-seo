It includes a stainless steel immersion blender, chopper, potato masher, and whisk, making it ideal for everyday meal prep. The 700W motor with Turbo mode and adjustable speeds ensure easy blending, and the pastel blue color adds a touch of style to your kitchen.
2.  **The Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher Blender**: This blender is another great option for small kitchens, featuring a 700W motor and patented Wave-Action system for smooth blends. The 40 oz. glass jar and 20 oz. travel cup make it perfect for families and individuals who need versatile, on-the-go blending. The blender is also easy to clean and maintain, with a compact design that won't take up too much space.
3.  **The KitchenAid Diamond Blender**: While not as compact as the first two options, this blender is still a great choice for small kitchens due to its durable design and easy-to-use interface. The Intelli-Speed control and diamond vortex ensure precise blending, and the 1.75L BPA-free pitcher is easy to clean and maintain. The blender also features settings for hot and cold blends, making it perfect for smoothies, soups, and sauces.

All three blenders are easy to use, durable, and compact, making them perfect for small kitchens. However, if you're looking for a more multi-functional design, the Smeg 4-in-1 Hand Blender may be the best choice. If you prioritize on-the-go blending, the Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher Blender may be the way to go. If you want a more premium blender with precise blending capabilities, the KitchenAid Diamond Blender is a great option. [/INST]
