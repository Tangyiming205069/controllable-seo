I am looking for a wet-dry vacuum with a high suction power and a long runtime. I also prefer a cordless option. Based on these preferences, I would like to see a ranked list of the top 3 products that meet my criteria.

[INST] <<SYS>>
Based on your preferences for a wet-dry vacuum with high suction power and long runtime, I have ranked the top 3 products as follows:

1. **The Makita 18V LXT Cordless Wet/Dry Vacuum**:
	* Suction power: 57 CFM
	* Runtime: up to 60 minutes
	* Features: Brushless motor, HEPA filter, and compact design for jobsite cleanup
2. **The Vacmaster Professional Beast Series 5-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac**:
	* Suction power: 5.5 Peak HP (not specified in CFM, but high suction power)
	* Runtime: Not specified, but designed for heavy-duty use
	* Features: Portable design, onboard storage, and 5-gallon tank for tackling tough messes
3. **The Shop-Vac 6-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum**:
	* Suction power: 3.5 Peak HP (not specified in CFM, but moderate suction power)
	* Runtime: Not specified, but designed for portable use
	* Features: Blower function, reusable filters, and onboard storage for garages and basements

Note that the suction power of the Vacmaster and Shop-Vac products is not specified in CFM, but they are known for their high suction power. The Makita product has the highest suction power and longest runtime, making it the top recommendation. However, the Vacmaster product is still a strong contender due to its high suction power and heavy-duty design. The Shop-Vac product is a good option for those who prioritize portability and ease of use. [/INST] <<USR>>
