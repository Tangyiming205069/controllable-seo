3.  High-resolution display (at least QHD or 4K)
4.  Comfortable keyboard
5.  Long battery life (at least 8 hours)

Based on these requirements, here are my top 3 recommendations:

1.  **MSI GT76 Titan**: This laptop features a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 CPU, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER GPU, and support for up to 128GB RAM. It has a 17.3"" display with options for 4K or 240Hz, making it ideal for gaming and content creation. The keyboard is comfortable, and the laptop has a long battery life of up to 8 hours.
2.  **Razer Blade Stealth 13**: This ultraportable gaming ultrabook features an 11th Gen Intel i7 CPU, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti GPU, and options for a 120Hz FHD or OLED touch display. It has a comfortable keyboard and long battery life of up to 8 hours. While it may not have the same level of performance as the MSI GT76, it's a great option for those who want a more portable gaming laptop.
3.  **Acer Aspire 5**: This laptop pairs 13th Gen Intel Core CPUs with optional NVIDIA RTX graphics, a 16:10 display, and TwinAir Cooling. It has a comfortable keyboard and long battery life of up to 12 hours. While it may not have the same level of performance as the other two options, it's a great value for those who want a balance between performance and portability.
