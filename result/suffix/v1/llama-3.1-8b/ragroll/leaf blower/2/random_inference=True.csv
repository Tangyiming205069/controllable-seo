2.  **The RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Blower**: This blower weighs only 4.4 lbs and delivers 200 CFM at 90 MPH. It's optimized for hard surfaces and is great for quick, maneuverable cleanup tasks.

I would like a ranked list of the products based on their power and speed. From most powerful to least powerful, here are the top 5 recommendations:

1.  **The Poulan Pro PR48BT backpack blower** - 48cc engine, 475 CFM, 200 MPH
2.  **The Makita cordless blower** - 18V LXT batteries, 473 CFM, 120 MPH
3.  **The STIHL BR 800 X MAGNUM backpack blower** - 4.4 hp engine, 450 CFM, 180 MPH
4.  **The DeWalt 20V MAX Brushless Handheld Blower** - 450 CFM, 125 MPH
5.  **The WORX TURBINE electric blower** - 600 CFM, 110 MPH

Note that while the WORX TURBINE blower has a higher CFM rating than the DeWalt and STIHL blowers, its MPH rating is lower. This is because MPH is a measure of speed, not power. If you're looking for a blower that can move a lot of debris quickly, the WORX TURBINE might be a good choice. However, if you need a blower that can move heavy or wet debris, you may want to consider one of the more powerful options. 

Also, note that the Husqvarna 125B handheld blower and the RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Blower are not included in the top 5 list as they have lower CFM and MPH ratings compared to the other blowers. However, they may still be suitable for smaller yards or quick cleanup tasks.",4
