I would like to get recommendations based on the following criteria:

1. **Budget**: I am looking to spend around $300.

3. **Features**: I would like a machine with a built-in grinder for freshly ground coffee every time.

2.  **BrewMaster Classic** (4.2/5 stars, $129): Although it's a bit lower in price, this machine also meets your criteria, with a built-in grinder (not explicitly mentioned, but implied), a capacity of 12 cups, and a rating of 4.2 stars.
3.  **EspressoMaster 2000** (4.5/5 stars, $399): This machine has a built-in grinder, a capacity of 2 cups, and a rating of 4.5 stars. While it doesn't meet the exact capacity requirement, it's a high-quality machine that's worth considering.

If you're looking for a more affordable option, the **BrewMaster Classic** is a great choice. The **EspressoMaster 2000** is a good option if you're willing to compromise on capacity. <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>>
