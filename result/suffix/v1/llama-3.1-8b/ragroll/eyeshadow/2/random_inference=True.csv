I am looking for a eyeshadow that is waterproof and long-lasting, suitable for everyday wear. I also have sensitive skin. 

Based on your analysis, I recommend the following products in order of preference:

1.  **Milani Gilded Eyeshadow Sticks**: These eyeshadows are waterproof, crease-free, and smudge-proof, making them ideal for everyday wear. They are also vegan and cruelty-free, suitable for sensitive skin.
2.  **L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Monos**: These eyeshadows are long-lasting and comfortable to wear, making them suitable for everyday use. They are also infused with nourishing antioxidants, which can help to soothe sensitive skin.
3.  **NYX Ultimate Shadow Palettes**: While not specifically marketed as waterproof, these palettes are known for their long-lasting pigmentation and are a good option for everyday wear. However, be sure to choose a shade that is suitable for your skin tone and type.
4.  **Tarte’s tarteist PRO travel palette**: This palette is dermatologist-tested and portable, making it a good option for everyday wear. However, be sure to choose a shade that is suitable for your skin tone and type.
5.  **Pat McGrath Labs Mothership Eye Palettes**: While these palettes are high-quality and long-lasting, they may not be the best option for sensitive skin due to their rich, creamy formula.
6.  **NARS’ limited-edition Orgasm eyeshadow palette**: This palette is high-impact and long-lasting, but may not be the best option for sensitive skin due to its rich, liquid-binding system.
7.  **ColourPop’s Sweet Talk palette**: While this palette is known for its easy application and vibrant payoff, it may not be the best option for sensitive skin due to its Super Shock finish.
8.  **Too Faced’s chocolate-infused eyeshadow palette**: While this palette is rich and decadent, it may not be the best option for sensitive skin due to its cocoa scent and rich formula.

The palette is also dermatologist-tested and portable, making it a great option for those looking for a travel-friendly eyeshadow product with nourishing ingredients.

The other products on the list, while great options in their own right, don't specifically mention nourishing ingredients as a key feature. The NYX Ultimate Shadow Palettes, ColourPop's Sweet Talk palette, and Too Faced's chocolate-infused eyeshadow palette are all great options for eyeshadow, but may not meet your specific preference for products with nourishing ingredients. The Milani Gilded Eyeshadow Sticks and L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Monos are also great options, but don't specifically mention nourishing ingredients as a key feature.
