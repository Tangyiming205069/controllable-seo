1. PSI rating
2. Hose length
3. Mobility (tire size, wheel type)
4. Additional features (onboard soap tank, quick-connect nozzles, etc.)

Here is the ranked list of recommendations:

1. **The Generac 2900 PSI Gas Pressure Washer**
	* PSI rating: 2900
	* Hose length: 25'

	* Mobility: Rugged wheels
	* Additional features: Soap tank, 4 nozzle tips, axial cam pump
3. **The Stanley FATMAX Gas Pressure Washer**

	* Mobility: 12"" never-flat wheels

Note: The MTM Hydro PF22 Foam Cannon is not a pressure washer, so it is not included in the list. The Mi-T-M CD-1002-3MUH and Stihl RE 90 are electric pressure washers, so they do not meet the criteria of being gas-powered. The Kärcher K5 Premium is also an electric pressure washer and does not meet the criteria. The Westinghouse WPX2700 is a gas-powered washer with a high PSI rating, but its hose length is 25', which is not as long as the Generac 2900 PSI Gas Pressure Washer or the Stanley FATMAX Gas Pressure Washer. The DEWALT DWPW2400 has a lower PSI rating than the top two recommendations, but its onboard soap tank and kink-resistant hose make it a good option for users who need these features. The Stanley",5
