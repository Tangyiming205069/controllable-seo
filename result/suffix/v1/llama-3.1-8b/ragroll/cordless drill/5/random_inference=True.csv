I am looking for a drill that is compact and lightweight, suitable for general DIY tasks. I am also looking for a drill with a high battery life and fast recharge times. Which drill from the list meets these requirements?

[INST] <<SYS>>
Based on your requirements, I recommend the following drill:

It also comes with two batteries, a charger, and a bag, which is a great value for the price. Additionally, its dual speed transmission and ergonomic grip provide a comfortable drilling experience.

While it doesn't specifically mention high battery life, the fact that it comes with two batteries suggests that it may have a longer battery life compared to other drills on the list.

However, if you're looking for a drill with specifically high battery life and fast recharge times, I would recommend considering the following drill:
