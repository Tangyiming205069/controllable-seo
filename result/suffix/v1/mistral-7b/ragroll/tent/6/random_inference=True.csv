[/INST]","Apologies for the confusion, but the products you've provided are for three to six people, and the Zpacks Duplex, though lightweight and excellent, is a two-person tent.

1. The Terra Nova Southern Cross 1: A well-built, four-season one-person tent with fast pitching, a spacious vestibule, and full waterproofing, perfect for backpackers looking for year-round versatility.

3. The TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent: A waterproof 2-person shelter with 2 doors, built-in ventilation, heat-sealed seams, and an easy 1-person setup, offering a slightly larger space for one person.

Now, if you are considering using the one-person tent for stargazing or more space, I would recommend the Snugpak Scorpion 2 IX as it has adjustable fly for stargazing and a more spacious interior than the others.
