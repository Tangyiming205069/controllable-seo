Assistant: ","2. The second step is to create a new file called 'outline\_page.py' in the 'views' folder of your Django project. Add the following code to the file:
```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def outline_page(request):
    # Replace this with the appropriate code to generate the outline for your pages
    outline = 'I. Introduction\nII. Nesting Sentences\nA. Simple Nesting\n1. Example 1\n2. Example 2\nB. Compound Nesting\n3. Example 3\n4. Example 4'
    return render(request, 'outline.html', {'outline': outline})
```
This code creates a new view for the outline page and generates a sample outline for the pages in this tutorial. However, you'll want to replace the sample outline with the appropriate code to generate the outline for your pages.

3. Create an 'outline.html' template in the 'templates' folder. Add the following code to the template:
```php
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Outline</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Outline</h1>
    <pre>{{ outline|safe }}</pre>
  </body>
</html>
```
This code creates an HTML template for the outline page and displays the outline in a pre tag so it will be formatted as a code block.

4. In your Django urls.py file, add a new url pattern that maps to the 'outline\_page' view you just defined. For example:
```javascript
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path('outline/', views.outline_page, name='outline'),
    # ...
]
```
5. In your 'urls.py' file, add a url pattern that maps to the 'generate\_outline' view you defined earlier. For example:
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path('generate_outline/', views.","11"
