1. BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Cordless Drill/Driver
   - Reason: Affordable, compact design, includes an 11-position clutch and LED work light, and has a shoulder hook-compatible housing.

2. Craftsman V20 1/2-in Cordless Drill/Driver
   - Reason: Compact, affordable, suitable for basic drilling and fastening in wood and tight spaces, and includes an LED work light. No mention of a shoulder hook, but it may be lightweight enough to carry without.
