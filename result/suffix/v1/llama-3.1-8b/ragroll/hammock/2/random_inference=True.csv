Based on your analysis, I recommend the following hammocks for your needs:

1.  **The Hennessy Expedition Classic Hammock**: This hammock is a top choice for both camping and backyard lounging.

Its modular design and optional underquilts make it an excellent choice for those seeking a high-quality sleeping system.
3.  **The Pawleys Island Large Quilted Hammock**: This stylish, two-person hammock is handmade in the Carolinas and features weather-resistant fabric, oak spreader bars, and non-absorbent polyester fiberfill. Its compact size and sturdy build make it ideal for backyard lounging, and its price is relatively affordable.
