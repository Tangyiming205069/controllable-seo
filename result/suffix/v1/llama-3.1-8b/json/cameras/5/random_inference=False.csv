2.  **ZoomMaster Pro**: A compact camera with powerful zoom, suitable for capturing distant subjects underwater. It features a resolution of 20 MP and is highly rated at 4.2 stars. Priced at $199, it is an excellent choice for Travel and wildlife enthusiasts who want to capture aquatic life.

Both of these cameras are designed to withstand water and can be used with waterproof housing, making them perfect for use in aquatic environments. The ActionCam Xtreme is a great choice for capturing high-quality video and photos in the water, while the ZoomMaster Pro is ideal for capturing distant subjects underwater.

I'm glad you found the recommendations helpful. If you have any further questions or would like to explore more options, feel free to ask! I'm here to assist you.

Also, I noticed that you mentioned ""waterproof housing camera"" in your request. I included the ActionCam Xtreme and ZoomMaster Pro in my previous response because they are both waterproof cameras. However, if you're looking for a camera that comes with a built-in waterproof housing, I can provide some additional recommendations.

Here are a few cameras that come with a built-in waterproof housing:

1.  **Fujifilm XP140**: A rugged and waterproof camera that can capture 4K video and 16.4 MP photos. It features a built-in waterproof housing that can withstand depths up to 82 feet.
2.  **Sony RX0 II**: A compact and waterproof camera that can capture 4K video and 15.3 MP photos. It features a built-in waterproof housing that can withstand depths up to 33 feet.

Please let me know if you'd like more information about these cameras or if you have any other questions! [/INST] <<SYS>>
