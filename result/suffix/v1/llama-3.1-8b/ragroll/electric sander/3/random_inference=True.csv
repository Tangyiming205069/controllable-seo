I need a sander that can handle large surfaces and has good dust collection. The Metabo FSX 200 Intec sander and the Bosch ROS20VSC are my top choices. However, I am concerned about the price of the Bosch ROS20VSC. Can you provide a more detailed comparison between the two products, including their prices, and suggest an alternative option that offers similar features at a lower price point?

Here is a summary of my requirements:

* Handle large surfaces
* Good dust collection
* Variable speed control
* Ergonomic design
* Compact size

Based on your analysis, I would like to know:

1. Which sander is better suited for handling large surfaces?
2. How do the two products compare in terms of dust collection?
3. What are the prices of the Metabo FSX 200 Intec sander and the Bosch ROS20VSC?
4. Is there an alternative option that offers similar features at a lower price point?

Please provide a detailed comparison of the two products and suggest an alternative option that meets your requirements.

[INST] <<SYS>>

Based on your requirements, I've analyzed the two products and provided a detailed comparison.

**Comparison of Metabo FSX 200 Intec and Bosch ROS20VSC:**

1. **Handling large surfaces:**
	* Both sanders are designed for handling large surfaces, but the Metabo FSX 200 Intec has a slightly larger pad size (6"" vs 5"") and a more powerful motor (11,000 RPM vs 7,500-12,000 OPM). However, the Bosch ROS20VSC has a more advanced dust collection system and a more ergonomic design.
2. **Dust collection:**
	* Both sanders have good dust collection systems, but the Bosch ROS20VSC has a microfilter dust canister and a vacuum adapter, making it more effective at capturing dust and debris. The Metabo FSX 200 Intec has a dust-proof bearing system, but it may not be as effective at capturing fine dust particles.
3. **Prices:**
	* The Metabo FSX 200 Intec sander typically costs around $250-$300.
	* The Bosch ROS20VSC sander typically costs around $400-$500.
4. **Alternative option:**
