I am looking for a coffee machine that can make lattes and cappuccinos. I have a budget of $500. I also want a machine that has a good capacity for a small household with 2 people. I would like a machine with a high rating and a built-in milk frother. I also want a machine that is easy to use and clean.

Based on your analysis, I recommend the following top 3 coffee machines that meet your criteria:

1.  **LatteArt Pro** ($599) - This machine has a high rating of 4.6 stars and a built-in milk frother for perfect lattes and cappuccinos. It has a capacity of 2 cups, making it perfect for a small household. It is also easy to use and clean, and has a sleek design.
2.  **Cappuccino King** ($799) - This machine has a high rating of 4.7 stars and a built-in milk frother for creating professional-quality cappuccinos. It has a capacity of 2 cups, making it perfect for a small household. It is also easy to use and clean, and has a sleek design.
3.  **Grind&Brew Plus** ($349) - This machine has a high rating of 4.4 stars and a built-in grinder for freshly ground coffee every time. It also has a built-in milk frother, making it perfect for lattes and cappuccinos. It has a capacity of 10 cups, but can be adjusted to 2 cups, making it suitable for a small household.

All of these machines meet your criteria, but I recommend the LatteArt Pro as the top choice due to its high rating and built-in milk frother. However, I understand that it is outside of your budget. The Grind&Brew Plus is a good alternative, as it has a built-in milk frother and a high rating, and is within your budget. The Cappuccino King is also a good option, but it is outside of your budget.

I hope this helps you make an informed decision! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like more information about these machines.",11

3. **ColdBrew Master** ($199) - 4.3 stars
4. **FrenchPress Classic** ($29) - 4.1 stars

Based on your budget and requirements, I recommend the **BrewMaster Classic** as the top choice. It's a durable and easy-to-use coffee maker with a timeless design, and it meets your capacity requirement. However, if you're looking for a more affordable option, the **FrenchPress Classic** is a great value for the price. The **ColdBrew Master** is also a good option, but it's a specialized machine for making cold brew coffee, so it might not be the best choice if you're looking for a more versatile coffee maker. The **Grind&Brew Plus** is above your budget, but it's a high-end machine with an integrated grinder, so it's worth considering if you're willing to splurge. [/INST] <<SYS>>

Here is the ranked list of coffee machines that meet your criteria:

1. **Grind&Brew Plus**: This machine has a built-in grinder and can make up to 10 cups of coffee at a time. It has a rating of 4.4 stars and is priced at $349, which is under the $200 limit. However, it's slightly above the budget, so I'll keep it as an alternative.
2. **FrenchPress Classic**: This machine can make up to 4 cups of coffee at a time and has a rating of 4.1 stars. It's priced at $29, which is within the budget. However, it doesn't have a built-in grinder or the ability to make multiple types of coffee drinks.
3. **BrewMaster Classic**: This machine can make up to 12 cups of coffee at a time and has a rating of 4.2 stars. It's priced at $129, which is within the budget. However, it doesn't have a built-in grinder or the ability to make multiple types of coffee drinks.

Based on your criteria, the top recommendation is the **BrewMaster Classic**, as it meets all the requirements and is priced within the budget. However, if you're looking for a machine with a built-in grinder, the **Grind&Brew Plus** is a good alternative, even though it's slightly above the budget.
