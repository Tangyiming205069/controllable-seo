To provide you with the most relevant recommendations, I'll consider the following factors:

1. User's skill level: Assuming the user is an intermediate to advanced woodworker.
2. Project requirements: Intricate and versatile woodworking projects.
3. Available budget: Not specified, but I'll assume a moderate to high budget.

Based on these factors, here's a ranked list of product recommendations:

1. **The Makita RT0701C Compact Router**: Offers a high level of precision and durability, making it an excellent choice for intricate and versatile woodworking projects. Its variable speed (10,000–30,000 RPM) and smooth rack-and-pinion depth adjustment provide flexibility and accuracy. ($129)
2. **The WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router**: Provides a wide range of speed options (8,000–23,000 RPM) and compatibility with both 1/4 and 1/2-inch bits, making it suitable for various woodworking tasks. The macro/micro adjustment and hard case with accessories are added bonuses. ($129)
3. **The Bosch MRF23EVS 2.3 HP Fixed-Base Router**: Features a powerful 15-Amp motor, Constant Response circuitry, and microfine depth adjustment, making it suitable for heavy-duty and precise woodworking projects. ($199)
4. **The RIDGID 1-1/2 HP Compact Router**: Offers a reliable and versatile solution for detailed routing tasks, with a soft start, variable speed, and micro-adjust dial for precision depth control. The spiral-in dust collection system is a nice feature. ($149)
5. **The SKIL 10 Amp Fixed Base Router**: A more budget-friendly option that still offers 6-speed control, LED work lighting, and ergonomic handles. However, it may not provide the same level of precision and power as the other options. ($69)

I've excluded the Axiom Overhead Dust System and the Rockwell 10pc T-Shank Blade Set as they are not routers, but rather a dust collection system and a blade set, respectively.
