*   **Customizable Settings**: The Miele dishwasher allows you to customize the EcoPower settings to suit your specific needs and preferences. You can adjust the water and energy consumption levels to balance performance, cost, and environmental impact.

I've extracted the key requirements from your request:

1. Unique connectivity (WiFi connectivity via SmartHQ app)
2. Sanitize cycle
3. A high-end product with a premium feel and design

Based on these requirements, I've ranked the products as follows:

1. **Haier’s ENERGY STAR Smart Dishwasher**:
	* Features WiFi connectivity via SmartHQ app for smart control and connectivity
	* Includes a sanitize cycle for thorough cleaning
	* Offers a stainless steel interior for a premium feel
	* ENERGY STAR certified for energy efficiency
2. **Frigidaire’s Professional Series dishwasher**:
	* Offers powerful cleaning and sleek stainless steel styling for a premium look
	* May not have WiFi connectivity, but it's a high-end product with a professional-grade performance
3. **Miele dishwasher**:
	* Features QuickIntenseWash for efficient cleaning, but no WiFi connectivity
	* Offers EcoPower tech for reduced water and energy use, but may not have the same level of connectivity as Haier's model

I've excluded the other products from the top recommendations as they don't meet the specific requirements you mentioned.

Based on your analysis, I recommend the following top 3 products for a dishwasher:

1.  **Haier’s ENERGY STAR** Smart Dishwasher**: This product is ranked as the top recommendation due to its excellent balance of performance, quiet operation, and smart control features. Its WiFi connectivity via SmartHQ™ and sanitize cycle make it a great choice for modern households.
2.  **KitchenAid's dishwasher**: This product offers a unique combination of flexible cleaning options, including the FreeFlex™ Third Rack and Advanced Clean Water Wash. Its 44 dBA quiet performance and fingerprint-resistant finish make it a great choice for households seeking spotless cleaning in a sleek design.

These three products offer a great balance of performance, features, and design, making them suitable for a wide range of users. However, if you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, the Avanti 24"" dishwasher or the Whirlpool's dishwasher may be worth considering. If you prioritize long-term reliability, the Maytag dishwasher may be the best choice. Ultimately, the best product for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences.
