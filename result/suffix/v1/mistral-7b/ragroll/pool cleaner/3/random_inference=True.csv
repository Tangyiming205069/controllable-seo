3. Suitability for in-ground pools
4. Quick and efficient cleaning

The recommendations would be:

1. Aiper Scuba S1 Pro robotic cleaner - Offers 100 GPM suction, wall, floor, and waterline cleaning capabilities, and 180-minute battery life, making it suitable for in-ground pools up to 2,150 sq.ft.

2. WYBOT’s cordless pool robot - Features a long 200-minute runtime, smart navigation, leak-proof design, and wall-climbing ability, ideal for fully automated pool cleaning.

3. The Mostiper Scuba S1 Pro robotic cleaner (as mentioned initially) - Offers powerful suction, multiple cleaning modes, and a long battery life, making it a solid choice for in-ground pools.

4. The Beatbot 5-in-1 cordless robot - While it wasn't listed initially, its 9 motors, 5500 GPH suction, and app-controlled cleaning feature make it a powerful option, though its battery life isn't specified.

5. Polaris Vac-Sweep 280 pressure-side cleaner - This cleaner uses a booster pump to clean in-ground pools efficiently, however, it doesn't provide cordless operation, and it's worth noting that the runtime may depend on the pool size.
