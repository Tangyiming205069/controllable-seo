[/INST]","Based on your request for a wood router, here are my top 3 recommendations:

1. WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router: With its wide speed range (8,000–23,000 RPM), 1/4 and 1/2-inch bit compatibility, macro/micro adjustment, and included hard case and accessories, this versatile wood router is an excellent choice for intricate woodworking projects.

2. Makita RT0701C Compact Router: This compact router from Makita delivers 1-1/4 HP with a variable speed (10,000–30,000 RPM) and a slim ergonomic body, making it perfect for precision and durability in woodworking tasks, as well as in tight spaces.

3. Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router: With its POWERSTATE Brushless Motor, cordless performance matching 1.25 HP corded routers, micro and macro depth adjustments, and dual LED lighting, this router is a robust choice for heavy-duty and precise routing tasks. It's especially recommended if you're searching for a cordless option.

Regarding the Rockwell 10pc T-Shank Blade Set and the RIDGID 1-1/2 HP Compact Router, while these are valuable additions for expanding your woodworking capabilities (blade set for blade changes and the compact router for precision), I've chosen routers as primary recommendations to help achieve a variety of woodworking projects.

For the Bosch MRF23EVS 2.3 HP Fixed-Base Router, it's an excellent heavy-duty router, though it might be a bit overkill for many home woodworking needs. However, it is an excellent choice for more heavy-duty projects.

Lastly, the SKIL 10 Amp Fixed Base Router with the SKIL Router Table SRT1039 is a great option for home workshops, providing various features like LED work lighting, ergonomic handles, and a router table for efficient and organized workspace solutions. However, a router by itself might be a better choice for this specific request.",4
