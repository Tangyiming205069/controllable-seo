Based on your request for a portable Bluetooth speaker with a battery life of at least 30 hours, I recommend the following products in order of ranking:

1. **Marshall Emberton II**: This speaker offers over 30 hours of playtime, rich sound, and a rugged design, making it a great choice for users who want long-lasting performance and iconic style. ($169.99)
