[/INST]","Based on your preference for a modern, high-quality skin cleansing brush for at-home use, especially considering the mention of FOREO LUNA 3's innovative features like its hygienic silicone design and customizable pulsations, I would suggest the following products that align with those preferences:

1. **FOREO LUNA 3**: This 2-in-1 cleansing and firming solution is praised for its ultra-hygienic silicone bristles, customizable T-Sonic pulsations, and its ability to remove 99.5% of impurities, making it an ideal choice for those seeking a high-quality, modern skincare solution at home.

2. **Soniclear Elite by Michael Todd**: This dermatologist-recommended sonic cleansing brush offers antimicrobial brush heads and is suitable for all skin types. Although it doesn't have the silicone bristles of the FOREO LUNA 3, it's a strong contender for those seeking a reliable, effective cleansing device.

3. **Liberex Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush**: This brush stands out for its ultra-soft silicone bristles, waterproof design, and long battery life. It's a great option if you're interested in a product with similar features as the FOREO LUNA 3 but at a more budget-friendly price point.

4. **Beurer Facial Cleansing Brush**: Although this device doesn't offer the advanced sonic technology or silicone bristles of the products above, it does have rotating brush heads suitable for sensitive skin types and offers deep cleansing. It could be a good choice if you prefer a more traditional brush design.

5. While the other products mentioned are great cleansing brushes, they don't align as closely with your preference for a modern, high-quality skincare solution at home, as specified in your request.
