Based on your request, I've ranked the products according to your specified criteria: large vising, user edge guided. Here's the list:

1. **The Bosch MRF23EVS 2.3 HP Fixed-Base Router**: This product is a top recommendation due to its large vising capacity and user-friendly edge guided features. Its 15 Amp motor and Constant Response circuitry make it perfect for heavy-duty, precise woodworking projects.
2. **The Makita RT0701C Compact Router**: This router offers a slim ergonomic body and smooth rack-and-pinion depth adjustment, making it ideal for precision and durability. Its variable speed (10,000–30,000 RPM) and 1-1/4 HP motor also make it a great choice for large vising tasks.
3. **The RIDGID 1-1/2 HP Compact Router**: This product features a soft start, variable speed, and micro-adjust dial for precision depth control, making it suitable for detailed routing tasks, including large vising.
4. **The SKIL 10 Amp Fixed Base Router**: While not as powerful as the top three, this router still offers 6-speed control, LED work lighting, and ergonomic handles, making it a good choice for users who prioritize user-friendly features and moderate vising capacity.
5. **The Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router**: Although it's a cordless option, this router still delivers impressive performance with its POWERSTATE Brushless Motor and micro and macro depth adjustments. However, its smaller size and lower power output compared to the top four products make it less suitable for large vising tasks.

The following products are not ranked due to not meeting the specified criteria:

* The Axiom Overhead Dust System is not a wood router and is not suitable for large vising tasks.
* The SKIL Router Table SRT1039 is a router table, not a handheld router, and is not designed for large vising.
* The Rockwell 10pc T-Shank Blade Set is a blade set, not a wood router, and is not suitable for large vising tasks.
* The WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router is a plunge router, which is not typically used for large vising tasks and may not offer the same level of precision as fixed-base routers. However, it's still a good option for users who prioritize versatility and intricate woodworking.",1
