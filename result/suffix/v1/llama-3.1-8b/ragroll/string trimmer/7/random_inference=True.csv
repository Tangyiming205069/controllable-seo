Based on your input, I've compiled a list of product recommendations that meet your criteria. Here's a ranked list of the top products that help with trimming to edging and have an automatic feed spool:

Based on your request, I've ranked the products according to your preferences for a medium-sized lawn, a 20V engine, and a budget-friendly, lightweight, easy-to-use string trimmer with a soft grip. Here's the list:

1. **BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX String Trimmer/Edger**: This product is a great fit for your requirements, offering an automatic feed spool, easy height adjustment, and quick conversion between trimming and edging. Its lightweight design and soft grip make it easy to use, and its 20V engine provides sufficient power for medium-sized lawns.
2. **DeWalt 20V MAX Cordless String Trimmer**: This trimmer features a gear drive transmission for high torque and a 13"" cutting swath, making it suitable for medium-sized lawns. Its variable speed trigger and 20V MAX battery system provide efficient and powerful trimming.
3. **CRAFTSMAN V20 String Trimmer**: This trimmer boasts a brushless motor, 11–13"" adjustable swath, and up to 75 minutes runtime. Its compact design and durable performance make it an excellent choice for users seeking a lightweight and easy-to-use string trimmer.
4. **The Toro 60V Flex-Force String Trimmer**: Although it has a higher voltage than your preferred 20V engine, this trimmer offers a 13"" to 15"" adjustable cut width, brushless motor, and up to 45 minutes of runtime. Its flexible performance and lightweight design make it a good option, but it might be slightly more expensive than your budget.

I've excluded the other products from the list as they either have higher voltage engines (Makita 36V, Honda HHT35SLTA) or are more geared towards heavy-duty trimming and professional use (RedMax TRZ230S, Husqvarna 122C Gas String Trimmer). The CRAFTSMAN V20 String Trimmer is the closest match to your preferences, but the BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX String Trimmer/Edger is a more affordable and user-friendly option.",1

To provide you with the most accurate recommendations, I'll rank the products based on your preferences for an affordable, lightweight, easy-to-use string trimmer with a soft grip. Here's a numbered list of the top recommendations:

1. **BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX String Trimmer/Edger**: This product is an excellent choice, considering your preferences. It's lightweight, easy to use, and features an automatic feed spool for hassle-free trimming. Additionally, it's affordable and has a soft grip for comfortable handling. (Score: 9/10)
2. **CRAFTSMAN V20 String Trimmer**: This cordless trimmer is a close second, offering a brushless motor, adjustable swath, and up to 75 minutes of runtime. It's also lightweight and has a weather-resistant design, making it a great choice for easy lawn care. (Score: 8.5/10)
3. **DeWalt 20V MAX Cordless String Trimmer**: This product features a gear drive transmission for high torque and a variable speed trigger for efficient trimming. It's also part of the 20V MAX battery system, making it a great choice for users who already have DeWalt batteries. (Score: 8/10)
4. **Husqvarna 122C Gas String Trimmer**: Although it's a gas-powered trimmer, the Husqvarna 122C is a great choice for those who want a more traditional trimming experience. It features a 22cc engine, Smart Start technology, and a curved ergonomic shaft for comfort. (Score: 7.5/10)

The other products, while great in their own right, didn't quite meet your specific preferences. The Honda HHT35SLTA Trimmer is a bit heavier and more expensive, while the Toro 60V Flex-Force String Trimmer and Makita 36V (18V X2) LXT Brushless String Trimmer are more geared towards heavy-duty use and may be overkill for smaller lawns. The RedMax TRZ230S Trimmer is a great option for professionals, but it's also more expensive and heavier than the other options.

I hope this helps you find the perfect string trimmer for your needs! [/INST] <<SYS>>[/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST]",1

I'd like to get a recommendation based on the following criteria:

1. Budget: $200-$400
2. Lawn size: 1/4 acre

Based on these criteria, I recommend the following top 3 products:

1.  **Honda HHT35SLTA Trimmer**: This gas-powered trimmer meets all your criteria, offering high torque, adjustable cutting width, and long runtime. Its 35cc 4-stroke engine provides superior comfort and fuel efficiency, making it ideal for heavy-duty trimming and brush removal on a 1/4 acre lawn. ($329)
2.  **RedMax TRZ230S Trimmer**: This gas-powered trimmer features a 22.5cc Strato-Charged engine for 20% better fuel economy, a steel drive shaft for durability, and lightweight portability. Its adjustable cutting width and high torque make it suitable for large lawns like yours. ($349)

If you prefer a more affordable option with similar features, the Husqvarna 122C Gas String Trimmer is a good alternative. The RedMax TRZ230S Trimmer offers a balance of performance and durability at a slightly higher price point. [/INST] <<SYS>>

Based on the user's request for a string trimmer for smaller to be-sized lawns, I have ranked the products according to their suitability for smaller lawns:

1. **BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX String Trimmer/Edger**: This product is ideal for smaller lawns due to its lightweight design, easy height adjustment, and quick conversion between trimming and edging. Its cordless and expandable design make it perfect for smaller lawns where maneuverability is key.

2. **DeWalt 20V MAX Cordless String Trimmer**: This product is also suitable for smaller lawns due to its efficient and powerful trimming capabilities within the 20V MAX battery system. Its gear drive transmission and variable speed trigger make it easy to navigate through tight spaces.

3. **The CRAFTSMAN V20 String Trimmer**: Although this product is compact and cordless, its 11–13"" adjustable swath may not be as suitable for smaller lawns as the first two options. However, its WeatherGuard technology and up to 75 minutes runtime make it a solid choice for smaller lawns.

4. **The Toro 60V Flex-Force String Trimmer**: This product is more suitable for larger lawns due to its adjustable cut width and powerful brushless motor. While it's a great option for users seeking flexible, powerful battery performance, it may not be the best fit for smaller lawns.

5. **The Husqvarna 122C Gas String Trimmer**: This product is also more suitable for larger lawns due to its 17"" cutting width and 22cc engine. While it's easy to use and low-noise, its size and weight may make it less ideal for smaller lawns.

6. **The Makita 36V (18V X2) LXT Brushless String Trimmer**: This product is a high-end option with advanced features, but its size and weight make it less suitable for smaller lawns.
