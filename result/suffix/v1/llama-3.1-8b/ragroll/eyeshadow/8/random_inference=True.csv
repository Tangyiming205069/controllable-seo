To provide the best recommendations, I'll need to understand your preferences. Can you please tell me what you're looking for in an eyeshadow? For example, do you have a specific color palette in mind (e.g. neutral, bold, natural), a finish preference (e.g. matte, shimmery, metallic), or any other specific requirements? <<SYS>>

I am looking for a eyeshadow that is long-lasting and easy to blend. I also want a palette that is portable and has a variety of shades. I don't have a specific color palette in mind, but I do want a palette that is versatile and can be used for both everyday and special occasions. 

Based on your preferences, here are some recommendations from the original list:

1. **Tarte’s tarteist PRO travel palette**: This palette is portable, long-lasting, and easy to blend. It features 6 Amazonian clay-infused shades in matte, metallic, and iridescent duochromes, making it versatile for everyday and special occasions.
2. **Pat McGrath Labs Mothership Eye Palettes**: Although this palette is larger than the Tarte palette, it's also portable and features 20 creamy, high-saturation shadows with wet/dry application. It's perfect for bold, customizable artistry and offers a wide range of shades for everyday and special occasions.
3. **NYX Ultimate Shadow Palettes**: These palettes are also portable and feature 16 high-pigment shades in bold, shimmery, or neutral combos. They're designed for creative freedom and are perfect for vibrant day-to-night eye looks.

These recommendations meet your requirements for long-lasting, easy-to-blend eyeshadows in portable palettes with a variety of shades. However, if you're looking for a more compact option, the Tarte palette might be the best choice. If you want a palette with even more shades, the Pat McGrath Labs Mothership Eye Palettes or the NYX Ultimate Shadow Palettes might be a better fit. <<SYS>>[INST] <<SYS>>
