If you have a preference for a more compact blender, you may also consider the Smeg 4-in-1 Hand Blender. However, keep in mind that hand blenders are not as powerful as traditional blenders, and the blending times may take longer for family-sized portions. The Breville’s Fresh & Furious Blender is another strong contender for a family-friendly blender, but its motor strength is less than the top two recommendations. The Oster Pro 1200 Blender would also work well for families, with its 1200 watts of power, pre-programmed settings, and portable travel cups, but its price point may be higher than some users would prefer. The Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher Blender, while versatile with 12 functions, might lack the power or capacity for a larger family. Lastly, the Blendtec Designer 650 S blender is an excellent choice for prosumers seeking premium performance, but its price point is higher, and its features might be overkill for the average family's needs.",2
