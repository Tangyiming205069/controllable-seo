I am looking for a tent that is highly waterproof and can withstand harsh weather conditions. I am willing to spend more money for a high-quality product. 

Based on your analysis, I recommend the following products in order of ranking:

1.  **The Snugpak Scorpion 2 IX**: This product is highly waterproof with a 5000mm HH PU flysheet and is designed for harsh-weather adventurers, making it an ideal choice for users who need a reliable shelter in extreme conditions.
2.  **The North Face Stormbreak 2**: This product features high-low ventilation and a waterproof build, making it suitable for harsh weather conditions. Although it is not as waterproof as the Snugpak Scorpion 2 IX, it is still a high-quality product that can withstand various weather conditions.
3.  **The Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 2 Tent**: This product features a lightweight waterproof build and adaptable fly for stargazing, making it suitable for harsh weather conditions. However, it may not be as waterproof as the top two products on this list.
4.  **The TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent**: This product is waterproof and features heat-sealed seams, making it suitable for harsh weather conditions. However, it may not be as durable as the top three products on this list.
5.  **The Marmot Limelight 2P Tent**: This product is waterproof and features a bathtub floor, but it may not be as suitable for harsh weather conditions as the top four products on this list.

I recommend the Snugpak Scorpion 2 IX as the top product due to its exceptional waterproofing and harsh-weather capabilities. However, if budget is a concern, the North Face Stormbreak 2 or the Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 2 Tent may be suitable alternatives. [/INST]

I'm looking for a tent that is suitable for a group of three people. I prioritize livability and scenery, but I also want a tent that is relatively easy to set up and has a spacious interior. Based on these preferences, I've ranked the products as follows:

1. The Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 2 Tent (very high priority)
2. The Marmot Limelight 2P Tent (high priority)
3. The North Face Stormbreak 2 (medium-high priority)
4. The Terra Nova Southern Cross 1 (medium priority)
5. The Snugpak Scorpion 2 IX (medium priority)
6. The NEMO Dragonfly OSMO Ultralight Tent (low-medium priority)
7. The TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent (low priority)
8. The Zpacks Duplex (very low priority)

Based on your analysis, which tent would you recommend for a group of three people? 

<<USR>>

Based on your preferences, I would recommend the Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 2 Tent. It is designed for two people, but it has a spacious interior and large doors that provide panoramic views, making it suitable for a group of three. The tent's adaptable fly also allows for stargazing, which aligns with your desire for livability and scenery. Additionally, the DAC Pressfit poles and lightweight waterproof build make it relatively easy to set up and provide a comfortable camping experience. However, please note that the tent is designed for two people, and you may need to adjust the interior layout to accommodate a group of three. 

If you're looking for a tent specifically designed for three people, you may want to consider the TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent, which has a total area of 3. feet and a standing height of 40 inches, as well as two doors and built-in ventilation. It's a more straightforward option for a group of three, but it may not offer the same level of livability and scenery as the Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 2 Tent. 

Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific needs and priorities. I recommend considering both options and reading reviews to determine which tent best fits your requirements. 

Ranking:

1. The Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 2 Tent (very high priority)
2. The TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent (high priority)
3. The Marmot Limelight 2P Tent (medium-high priority)

I can provide you with a ranked list of product recommendations based on your preferences. However, I need to clarify a few things to ensure I get it right.

From the products listed, I understand you're looking for a tent that has:

1. Better storage room
2. Windows
3. A more spacious interior

Is that correct?

Also, please note that some products have multiple features that might match your preferences. I'll do my best to rank them based on your requirements.

Here's a numbered list of product recommendations, ranked from highest to lowest based on your preferences:

1. **The Marmot Limelight 2P Tent**: This tent offers a roomy 2-person design with dual vestibules, providing ample storage room and a spacious interior. It also features a bathtub floor and included footprint for added durability.
2. **The North Face Stormbreak 2**: This tent features large doors, twin-zip vestibules, and high-low ventilation, making it an excellent choice for those seeking a comfortable camping experience. Its roomy interior and easy-pitch design also make it a great option.
3. **The TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent**: While not as spacious as the top two options, this tent offers a waterproof 2-person shelter with 2 doors, built-in ventilation, and heat-sealed seams. It also has a decent storage capacity and windows for added ventilation.
4. **The Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 2 Tent**: This tent features oversized doors for panoramic views, but its interior space is somewhat limited compared to the top three options. However, its adaptable fly and DAC Pressfit poles make it a great choice for campers wanting livable comfort and scenery.

The other products listed, while excellent in their own right, don't quite match your specific preferences for better storage room, windows, and a more spacious interior.

Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything or if you have any further questions!",3

Based on your request, I've analyzed the products and ranked them according to your needs for a 3-person tent with a total area of 3. feet and a standing height of 42 inches. Here's the list of recommendations:

1.  **The North Face Stormbreak 2**: Although it's a 2-person tent, it's one of the largest options available, with a spacious interior and high-low ventilation. It's a great choice if you're willing to compromise on the number of occupants to get a larger tent.
2.  **The Marmot Limelight 2P Tent**: This tent offers a roomy design with pre-bent poles, dual vestibules, and a bathtub floor. It's a great option for 3 people, but you might need to adjust the layout to accommodate the extra person.
3.  **The Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 2 Tent**: This tent features oversized doors for panoramic views and adaptable fly for stargazing. It's a great choice if you prioritize livable comfort and scenery.
4.  **The TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent**: This tent offers a waterproof 2-person shelter with 2 doors, built-in ventilation, and an easy 1-person setup. It's a great option if you're looking for a lightweight backpacker's tent that can accommodate 3 people.
5.  **The NEMO Dragonfly OSMO Ultralight Tent**: This tent features sustainable, PFAS-free fabric and asymmetrical vestibules. It's a great choice if you prioritize performance and packability, but it might be a tighter fit for 3 people.

Unfortunately, none of the products exactly match your requirements, but these recommendations should provide a good starting point for your search. Keep in mind that you may need to adjust your expectations or consider a larger tent to accommodate your needs.

Here are some additional suggestions to consider:

* Look for tents with a floor area of at least 28 square feet to accommodate 3 people comfortably.
* Consider tents with a peak height of at least 42 inches to ensure standing room.
* Check the weight and packability of the tent to ensure it's suitable for backpacking or camping.
* Research the tent's weather resistance, ventilation, and ease of setup to ensure it meets your needs.

I hope this helps you find the perfect tent for your needs! [/INST] <<SYS>>[/INST] [/INST] [/INST]",4
