Based on the provided list, I'd like to know the top 3 recommendations for a hedge trimmer that can handle thick branches, has a long cutting bar, and is lightweight. Here are my specific requirements:
1. Can cut branches up to 1 inch or thicker
2. Has a long cutting bar (at least 22 inches)
3. Is lightweight (less than 10 pounds)

Rank the products based on these criteria, and provide a numbered list of the top 3 recommendations. 

Please note that I'm looking for a product that meets all three criteria, so I'd like to see a ranking of products that excel in all areas. 

Here are the specific requirements:

* Can cut branches up to 1 inch or thicker
* Has a long cutting bar (at least 22 inches)
* Is lightweight (less than 10 pounds)

Based on these requirements, here are my top 3 recommendations:

1. **The Craftsman V20 Cordless Hedge Trimmer**
	* Can cut branches up to 1.5 inches thick (exceeds requirement)
	* Features 22-inch dual-action blades (meets requirement)
	* Weighs 7.9 pounds (meets requirement)
2. **The Poulan Pro PR2322 gas hedge trimmer**
	* Can cut branches up to 1 inch thick (meets requirement)
	* Features 22-inch dual-sided blades (meets requirement)
	* Weighs 9.1 pounds (just above the requirement, but still a strong contender)
3. **The Husqvarna 122HD60 gas hedge trimmer**
	* Can cut branches up to 1 inch thick (meets requirement)
	* Features a long cutter bar (meets requirement, but exact length not specified)
	* Weighs 9.5 pounds (just above the requirement, but still a strong contender)

Note that the DeWalt 20V MAX Hedge Trimmer and the BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer do not meet the requirements, as they have shorter cutting bars and/or lower cutting capacities.

Based on these rankings, I recommend the Craftsman V20 Cordless Hedge Trimmer as the top choice, followed closely by the Poulan Pro PR2322 gas hedge trimmer and the Husqvarna 122HD60 gas hedge trimmer.

I would like a list of the top 5 recommendations for a hedge trimmer based on the following criteria: 
1. High power output
2. Long cutting bar
3. Ergonomic design
4. Reduced vibration
5. Dual-sided blades

Here is the ranked list based on the user's request:

1.  **The STIHL HS 82 T**: This hedge trimmer is the top recommendation due to its high power output (up to 5,100 strokes/min), long cutting bar, ergonomic design, reduced vibration, and dual-sided blades. Its 2-MIX engine provides efficient performance, and its dual-sided blades ensure precise cutting.
2.  **The Poulan Pro PR2322**: This gas hedge trimmer ranks second due to its high power output (23cc 2-cycle engine), long cutting bar, and ergonomic design. Although it lacks reduced vibration features, its anti-vibration tech provides some comfort during use.
3.  **The Husqvarna 122HD60**: This hedge trimmer ranks third due to its long cutting bar, Smart Start system, and LowVib tech for reduced vibration. Although it lacks high power output, its lightweight and comfortable design make it suitable for precision hedge shaping.
4.  **The DeWalt 20V MAX Hedge Trimmer**: This cordless hedge trimmer ranks fourth due to its high power output, long cutting bar, and ergonomic design. Although it lacks dual-sided blades, its 22"" laser-cut blades provide clean cuts.
