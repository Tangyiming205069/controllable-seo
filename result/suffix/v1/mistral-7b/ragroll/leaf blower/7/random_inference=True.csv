[/INST]","Based on your request for a powerful leaf blower suitable for large property cleanup, here are my top three recommendations:

1. STIHL BR 800 X MAGNUM Backpack Blower: This product stands out due to its pro-grade performance and exceptional features. With a 4.4 hp engine, it delivers an impressive 470 CFM and 170 MPH, making it ideal for handling large volumes of leaves and debris. Additionally, the anti-vibration system ensures user comfort during extended use, while the ergonomic harness, tool-free adjustments, and 4-MIX® engine contribute to its overall efficiency and convenience.

3. Husqvarna 125B Handheld Blower: Although it's a handheld model, the Husqvarna 125B offers impressive power with 470 CFM and 170 MPH, making it powerful enough for large properties. Its air purge system simplifies starting, and multi-speed control allows for tailored airflow. At only 9.4 lbs, it is relatively lightweight, and the ergonomic design ensures user comfort during extended use. If you prefer a handheld model with high power, the Husqvarna 125B could be an excellent choice.

For those looking for a lightweight, cordless alternative, the BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Sweeper could also be a good option. Although it is not as powerful as the other three recommendations, it is",9
