To provide you with the best space heater recommendations, I'll consider your request for a product that is slim in design and suitable for medium-sized rooms. I'll also prioritize quiet operation. Based on your preferences, here's a ranked list of product recommendations:

1.  **Dreo Portable Space Heater**: This heater is slim in design, uses 1500W PTC ceramic heating, and can warm a room in just 3 seconds. It features 65° oscillation, remote control, and ultra-quiet 40dB operation, making it perfect for efficient and peaceful home heating in medium-sized rooms.
2.  **Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater**: Although not as slim as the Dreo, the Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater offers widespread oscillation, an elongated heating element, programmable thermostat, seven-hour timer, and remote control. It's a great option for safe, efficient heating of medium-sized rooms and is relatively quiet with a 40dB operation.
3.  **The De’Longhi TRRS0715E Radiant Heater**: This radiant heater features a digital LED panel, ECO function, and 24-hour timer, delivering 1500W of quiet, allergy-friendly heat. While not as slim as the top two recommendations, it's a great option for medium-sized rooms and is relatively quiet with a 39dB operation.
4.  **The Pelonis 1500W Electric Oil Radiator Heater**: This oil radiator heater features adjustable thermostat, five heat settings, a 10-hour programmable timer, and a remote control. It's a good option for users seeking efficient, low-surface-temperature radiant heat in medium-sized rooms, but it may not be as slim in design as the top recommendations.
5.  **The Honeywell 360° Surround Heater**: While this heater offers all-around warmth and 360° tip-over safety, it may not be the best fit for medium-sized rooms due to its larger size and higher price point. It's still a reliable choice, but it may not meet your slim design requirement.

Based on your preferences, I recommend the Dreo Portable Space Heater as the top choice. Its slim design, efficient heating, and quiet operation make it an excellent option for medium-sized rooms. If you're looking for alternative options, the Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater and The De’Longhi TRRS0715E Radiant Heater are also great choices. <<SYS>>[",4
