To provide you with the best lipstick recommendations, I'll consider your preferences for products without harming-derived ingredients and a wide range of color options. Here's a ranked list of lipsticks that fit your criteria:

1. **NARS Audacious Lipstick**: This lipstick offers a wide range of 40 shades, making it suitable for various skin tones. It's also free from harming-derived ingredients and provides single-stroke, satin-finish coverage with a creamy texture that hydrates and prevents feathering.
2. **MAC Love Me Lipstick**: MAC is a cruelty-free brand, and this lipstick is infused with argan oil for all-day moisture. It offers a wide range of shades, including vibrant reds, flattering neutrals, and expressive bolds, making it suitable for various skin tones.
3. **L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Intense Volume Matte Lipstick**: This lipstick is also free from harming-derived ingredients and offers 16-hour bold color with hyaluronic acid for fuller, hydrated lips. It's available in a wide range of shades, ensuring there's something for every skin tone.
4. **Maybelline Super Stay Matte Ink**: While not all Maybelline products are cruelty-free, this particular lipstick is a good option for those looking for a wide range of shades (36 available) and a no-transfer formula that lasts up to 16 hours.
5. **Revlon ColorStay Matte Lite Crayon**: This lipstick is also free from harming-derived ingredients and offers a wide range of shades. However, it's worth noting that Revlon is a brand that has faced criticism in the past regarding animal testing. If you're concerned about this, you may want to consider one of the other options.

The following lipsticks didn't make the cut due to either limited shade options or the presence of harming-derived ingredients:

* Too Faced Melted Matte Lipstick (while a great product, it's not as widely available in terms of shades as some of the other options)
* Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick (contains beeswax, which may not be suitable for those looking for completely harming-derived ingredient-free products)
* Charlotte Tilbury's Pillow Talk collection (while a great brand, this specific collection is more focused on nude-pink shades, which may not be as extensive as some users would like)

I hope this helps you find the perfect lipstick that fits your preferences!",1

4. **Too Faced Melted Matte Lipstick**: With its 8-hour wear, plumping formula, and smooth feel, this lipstick is perfect for those who want a bold, ultra-matte color without dryness. Its avocado oil and hyaluronic spheres ensure hydration and comfort. (Score: 8.5/10)
5. **Maybelline Super Stay Matte Ink**: While it offers long-lasting color and a no-transfer formula, this lipstick falls short in terms of hydration and comfort. However, its 36 shades and affordable price make it a great option for those on a budget. (Score: 8.0/10)
6. **Revlon ColorStay Matte Lite Crayon**: This lipstick is lightweight, smudge-proof, and water-resistant, but its 30% lighter formula may not provide the same level of hydration as other options. Its mango seed oil and precise crayon design make it a good choice for those seeking comfort and ease of use. (Score: 7.8/10)
7. **Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick**: While it offers long-lasting color and a precise applicator, this lipstick may not be the most comfortable option due to its matte finish. Its customizable formula and comfort make it a good choice for those who prioritize flexibility. (Score: 7.5/10)
