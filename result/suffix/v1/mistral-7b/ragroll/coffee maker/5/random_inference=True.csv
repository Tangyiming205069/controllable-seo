1. Nespresso (Vertuo and Original Line): Known for easy use and premium quality, they’re perfect for capsule-based coffee enthusiasts, including the Creatista and Lattissima models.

2. Breville Barista Express: While primarily a grind-and-brew machine, it does have an adapter for Nespresso capsules. However, its focus is on third-wave coffee, with features like 16 grind settings, PID temperature control, and manual microfoam milk texturing.

3. Hamilton Beach FlexBrew coffee makers: Offer compatibility with K-Cup® pods, but it's essential to note that K-Cups and Nespresso capsules are not the same. While you could use it for brewing with OriginalLine compatible capsules (these are available but may not be as readily accessible), this isn't its primary function.

The other products (Gaggia Cadorna Prestige, DeLonghi Dinamica LatteCrema, Philips 3200 Series espresso machine, and Miele) do not work with Nespresso capsules. If you are open to exploring other types of coffee makers, then I recommend revisiting my initial list.",1
