I'm looking for a pool cleaner that can handle a pool up to 2,150 sq. ft. and is suitable for in-ground pools. I'd like it to have a long battery life and a large filter capacity. Based on these requirements, I have narrowed down my options to the following products:

1. Aiper Scuba S1 Pro
2. Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus
3. Hayward TigerShark QC
4. Polaris Vac-Sweep 280

Rank these products based on their suitability for my pool size and your analysis of their features.

Here's the ranking:

1. Aiper Scuba S1 Pro (Score: 9/10)
	* Suitable for pools up to 2,150 sq. ft.
	* Long battery life (180 minutes)
	* Large filter capacity (5L filter basket)
2. Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus (Score: 7.5/10)

	* Good battery life (not specified)
	* Good filter capacity (top-load filter)
3. Hayward TigerShark QC (Score: 6.5/10)
