To rank the Hayward TigerShark QC robotic cleaner at the top of the recommendation, I will use a prompt that highlights its key features and advantages over the other products. Here is a revised prompt:

Based on your preferences for a pool cleaner that can clean the bottom and is easy to maneuver around a smaller yard, I recommend the following products in order of their suitability:

1.  **Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus**: This robotic cleaner is specifically designed for in-ground pools and can clean the bottom in under 2 hours. Its top-load filter and plug-and-play design make it easy to use and maintain. The 60ft cable allows for easy maneuverability around a smaller yard.
2.  **The Polaris Vac-Sweep 280**: This pressure-side cleaner is designed for in-ground pools and can clean the bottom in under 3 hours. While it may not be as fast as the Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus, it's a reliable and efficient option that can be easily maneuvered around a smaller yard.
3.  **The Hayward TigerShark QC**: This robotic cleaner is designed for in-ground pools and can clean the bottom in under 2 hours. While it may not have the same level of maneuverability as the Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus, it's a reliable and efficient option that can be easily installed and maintained.

I did not recommend the following products as they may not meet your specific needs:

*   The VINGLI automatic pool vacuum is a good option, but it may not be as efficient as the top two recommendations for cleaning the bottom of the pool.
*   The Water Tech Pool Blaster Max Li is a good option for spot cleaning, but it may not be as efficient as the top two recommendations for cleaning the entire bottom of the pool.
*   The Aiper Scuba S1 Pro robotic cleaner is a good option, but it may not be as easy to maneuver around a smaller yard as the top two recommendations.
*   The WYBOT’s cordless pool robot and The Beatbot 5-in-1 cordless robot are good options, but they may not be as efficient as the top two recommendations for cleaning the bottom of the pool and may require more maintenance.

Based on your request, I've analyzed the products and ranked them according to your preferences:

1. **The Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus**: This product is highly recommended due to its ability to clean pool floors and walls in under 2 hours, making it a great fit for your requirement to clean the bottom. Additionally, its plug-and-play design and 60ft cable make it easy to maneuver around smaller yards.
2. **The Hayward TigerShark QC**: Although it doesn't specifically mention cleaning the bottom, this product is a close second due to its efficient 90-minute cycle, cartridge filter, and automatic whole-pool coverage. Its microprocessor-based tech and no need for external pumps or hoses make it a convenient option.
3. **The Polaris Vac-Sweep 280**: This product is a good choice for in-ground pools, but it might not be the best fit for smaller yards due to its hose and booster pump requirements. However, its double jets and dedicated filter bag make it a solid option for pool cleaning.
4. **The Water Tech Pool Blaster Max Li**: This cordless rechargeable vacuum is a good option for spot or whole-pool cleaning, but its 1-hour runtime might not be enough for larger pools. Its high-capacity debris chamber and 10.5"" head make it a good choice for above-ground and in-ground pools.
5. **The Beatbot 5-in-1**: Although it's a cordless robot with many features, its 9 motors and 5500 GPH suction might make it more suitable for larger pools. Its app-controlled design and OTA updates are great, but its price and complexity might make it less accessible for smaller yards.
6. **The WYBOT**: This cordless pool robot offers app-controlled cleaning and smart navigation, but its 200-minute runtime and leak-proof design might not be enough to justify its higher price point.
7. **The Aiper Scuba S1 Pro**: This robotic cleaner has strong suction and a 5L filter basket, but its 180-minute battery life and dual PVC rollers might make it more suitable for larger pools.
8. **The VINGLI automatic pool vacuum**: This product is a good option for stress-free pool maintenance, but its compatibility with 3/4hp pumps and jam-free cleaning might not be enough to justify its ranking.

Based on your preferences, I recommend starting with the **Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus",1

I'm happy to help you find the perfect pool cleaner based on your preferences! Based on your requirements, I've ranked the top 3 recommendations for you:

1. **The Aiper Scuba S1 Pro robotic cleaner**: This is a top pick for its powerful suction, large filter basket, and long battery life (180 minutes). It's ideal for in-ground pools up to 2,150 sq.ft. and offers wall, floor, and waterline modes.
2. **The Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus**: This cleaner is a close second for its ease of use, energy-saving features, and hassle-free design. It cleans pool floors and walls in under 2 hours and comes with a 60ft cable and weekly timer.
3. **The WYBOT cordless pool robot**: This is a great option for its app-controlled cleaning, smart navigation, and wall-climbing ability. It offers 6 cleaning paths, triple motors, and a 200-minute runtime, making it ideal for fully automated pool cleaning.

I've excluded the other options because they either don't meet your specific requirements (e.g., the Polaris Vac-Sweep 280 is a pressure-side cleaner, which might not be as easy to maneuver around a smaller yard) or have limitations that don't align with your needs (e.g., the Water Tech Pool Blaster Max Li has a shorter runtime and is more suited for spot cleaning). The Beatbot 5-in-1 and Hayward TigerShark QC are great cleaners, but they don't offer the same level of ease of use and maneuverability as the top 3 recommendations.
