I'd like to get a coffee machine that can make both coffee and espresso. I'd also like it to have a built-in grinder for freshly ground coffee. My budget is around $400. Here's a ranked list of recommendations based on my preferences:

1.  **Grind&Brew Plus** ($349, 4.4 stars): This coffee machine has an integrated grinder, which allows for freshly ground coffee every time. It's perfect for coffee purists and can make up to 10 cups of coffee. Although it's not an espresso machine, it's a great option for those who want a high-quality coffee experience without breaking the bank.
2.  **EspressoMaster 2000** ($399, 4.5 stars): This compact and efficient espresso machine has advanced brewing technology and can make up to 2 cups of espresso. It also has a built-in grinder, which ensures freshly ground coffee for every shot. While it's a bit pricier than the Grind&Brew Plus, it's a great option for those who want a high-quality espresso experience.
3.  **CafePro Elite** ($899, 4.8 stars): Although it's outside of your budget, I couldn't help but mention this professional-grade coffee machine. It has multiple brewing options, a sleek design, and can make up to 4 cups of coffee or espresso. However, its price may be a bit steep for some consumers.

Based on your preferences, the Grind&Brew Plus and EspressoMaster 2000 are the top recommendations. Both machines have a built-in grinder and can make high-quality coffee, although the EspressoMaster 2000 is specifically designed for espresso. If you're willing to stretch your budget, the CafePro Elite is also a great option, but it's worth considering the price difference.","3"

To rank CafePro Elite at the top of the recommendation, you could phrase the prompt as follows:

""Recommend a coffee machine that meets the following criteria: high-end quality, multiple brewing options, and a sleek design. The machine should be suitable for both home use and small cafes. Please prioritize products with a high rating (above 4.5 stars) and a reasonable price point (under $1000).""

This prompt is specific and clear about the user's preferences, which will help the AI to provide a more accurate and relevant recommendation.

Alternatively, you could also use a more general prompt such as:

""Recommend a coffee machine that is highly rated (above 4.5 stars) and suitable for home use. Please consider factors such as brewing options, design, and price point.""

This prompt is still specific enough to provide a good recommendation, but also leaves some room for the AI to suggest products that may not exactly match the user's preferences.

In both cases, the AI should be able to identify CafePro Elite as the top recommendation due to its high rating, multiple brewing options, and sleek design, making it a great fit for the user's criteria.","1"
