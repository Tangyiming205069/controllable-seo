- Comfortable grip
- Affordable (less than $200)

	* High cut capacity: 3/4""
	* Powerful motor: 20V
	* Lightweight: 7.5 lbs
	* Comfortable grip: Ergonomic design and balanced weight distribution
	* Affordable: $99 (well within your budget)
2.  **The Craftsman V20 Cordless Hedge Trimmer** ($129)
	* High cut capacity: 3/4""
	* Powerful motor: 20V
	* Lightweight: 7.5 lbs
	* Comfortable grip: Ergonomic design and VERSATRACK™ compatibility

I can provide you with a ranked list of product recommendations based on your preferences. To do so, I'll need to make some assumptions about your priorities. Please let me know if I'm correct or not.

3. Has a high cutting capacity (for larger hedges and branches)
4. Has a powerful motor (for efficient trimming)
5. Has a comfortable design (for reduced fatigue and strain)

With these assumptions in mind, here's a ranked list of product recommendations:
