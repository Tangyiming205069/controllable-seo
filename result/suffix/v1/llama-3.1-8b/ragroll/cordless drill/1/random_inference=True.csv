To provide the best recommendations, I'll rank the products based on the user's preferences and needs. Since the user is looking for a standard and compact drill for everyday and light tasks, I'll focus on the following criteria:

1. **Torque and power**: For light tasks, a moderate level of torque is sufficient.
2. **Battery life and charging**: Fast recharge times and reliable battery performance are essential.
3. **Compact design**: A smaller drill is easier to handle and store.
4. **Price**: A reasonable price point is expected for a standard drill.

Based on these criteria, here are my top recommendations:

1. **The Craftsman V20 1/2-in Cordless Drill/Driver**: This drill meets all the user's requirements, offering 280 unit watts out, a 2-speed gearbox, and a compact design. It's also priced reasonably, making it an excellent choice for everyday and light tasks. (Score: 9/10)
