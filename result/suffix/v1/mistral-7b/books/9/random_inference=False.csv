While 'Alien Invasion' by Michael Star and 'Galactic Journey' by Mark Davis are also science fiction novels, their themes lean more towards space battles and exploration rather than mystery. 'The Hidden Treasure' by Lisa Brown and 'The Enchanted Island' by Robert Green, although rated highly, are primarily adventure novels infused with elements of treasure hunting and fantasy, which may not quite match your preference for mystery. 'Whispers in the Dark' by James White, while a mystery novel, is focused on ghost stories, which is somewhat different from the traditional detection mystery you may be seeking. 'The Great Adventure' by John Smith, while a great adventure novel, may not offer the same level of mystery and intrigue as the other recommendations due to its focus on exploration and discovery in uncharted lands.
