To provide the most accurate recommendations, I'll rank the products based on your request for a differential that's ideal for mate-lasting performance with heavy jobs. Considering the provided information, I'll focus on the products with higher amp ratings and RPM capabilities.

Here's a ranked list of product recommendations:

1.  **Porter-Cable 5"" Random Orbit Sander**: With a 10.5 amp motor generating 12,000 RPM, this product stands out for its high output and controlled finishing system, making it ideal for heavy jobs and long-lasting performance.
2.  **Metabo FSX 200 Intec Sander**: Although it has a lower amp rating (not explicitly mentioned), its 11,000 RPM and lightweight design make it suitable for fatigue-free fine sanding, which can be beneficial for heavy jobs.
3.  **The DeWalt DWE6423 5"" Variable Speed Sander**: With a 3 amp motor and 8,000–12,000 OPM, this product is still a strong contender, but its lower amp rating compared to the top two options may affect its performance with heavy jobs.
4.  **Milwaukee’s M18 Random Orbit Sander**: Although it has a high variable speed range (7,000–12,000 OPM), its 3.0Ah battery and REDLITHIUM™ tech may not provide the same level of performance as the top two options with heavy jobs.
5.  **Bosch ROS20VSC**: With a variable speed range of 7,500–12,000 OPM, this product is suitable for woodworkers, but its lower amp rating (not explicitly mentioned) may limit its performance with heavy jobs.
6.  **The RYOBI 18V ONE+ Random Orbit Sander**: As a cordless option, it may struggle with heavy jobs due to its 18V battery and 10,000 OPM.
7.  **The BLACK+DECKER MOUSE** 20V MAX*: With a high RPM rating (12,000 OPM) but a lower amp rating (20V MAX*), this product may not provide the same level of performance as the top options with heavy jobs.
8.  **The SKIL Random Orbital Sander**: As a compact and low-vibration option, it may not be the best choice for heavy jobs due to its 2.8 amp motor and variable",1
