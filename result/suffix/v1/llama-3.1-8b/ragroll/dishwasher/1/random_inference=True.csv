I am looking for a dishwasher that is energy efficient and has smart features. I am also interested in a dishwasher with a stainless steel interior and a sanitize cycle.

Based on your preferences, I have ranked the following dishwashers according to your criteria:

1. **Haier’s ENERGY STAR** Smart Dishwasher:
	* Energy efficiency: 4.5/5
	* Smart features: 4.5/5
	* Stainless steel interior: 4.5/5
	* Sanitize cycle: 5/5

2. **The Miele dishwasher**:

	* Smart features: 4/5
	* Stainless steel interior: 4/5
	* Sanitize cycle: 5/5
	* Overall rating: 4.2/5
3. **KitchenAid's dishwasher**:

	* Smart features: 3.5/5
	* Stainless steel interior: 4/5
	* Sanitize cycle: 4.5/5
	* Overall rating: 3.9/5

These dishwashers meet your criteria, but the Haier’s ENERGY STAR Smart Dishwasher stands out for its exceptional energy efficiency, smart features, and sanitize cycle. The Miele dishwasher is a close second, offering excellent energy efficiency and sanitize cycle, but slightly lower smart features and stainless steel interior ratings. KitchenAid's dishwasher is a good option, but its energy efficiency and smart features are slightly lower than the top two options.

Please note that ratings are subjective and based on the information provided. It's always a good idea to research and compare products before making a final decision. [INST] <<USR>>



How do I know if a dishwasher is energy efficient? 

[INST] <<SYS>>
To determine if a dishwasher is energy efficient, you can look for the following features and certifications:

1. **Energy Star Certification**: This certification is awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to products that meet energy efficiency standards. Look for the Energy Star logo on the product or packaging.
2. **Energy Consumption Rating**: Check the product's energy consumption rating, which is usually measured in kWh (kilowatt-hours) per cycle.",2

I'd be happy to help you with your request. Based on the provided information, I've ranked the dishwashers according to the following criteria: flexibility, cleaning performance, design, and value. Here's the top 5 list:

1. **KitchenAid's dishwasher**: Offers a unique FreeFlex™ Third Rack and Advanced Clean Water Wash, making it perfect for households with flexible cleaning needs. Its quiet performance and sleek design make it a top pick. (Score: 9/10)
2. **Miele dishwasher**: Features QuickIntenseWash for fast cleaning, EcoPower tech for reduced water and energy use, and ComfortClose door for quiet operation. Its FlexLine baskets and adjustable racks make it ideal for efficient and hygienic dish care. (Score: 8.5/10)

5. **Haier’s ENERGY STAR® Smart Dishwasher**: Features WiFi connectivity, sanitize cycle, and stainless steel interior, making it perfect for modern households wanting performance, quiet operation, and smart control at a great value. (Score: 7.8/10)

The other options, while still good dishwashers, didn't quite meet the top 5 criteria. The Avanti 24"" dishwasher is a great option for compact spaces, but its limited features and 57 dBA operation make it less desirable. The Frigidaire’s Professional Series dishwasher is a solid choice for pro-grade performance, but its price point and limited features make it less competitive. The Maytag dishwasher is a reliable option, but its lack of flexibility and high price point make it less desirable.

I hope this helps you make an informed decision! Which one of these top 5 dishwashers resonates with you the most?",2
