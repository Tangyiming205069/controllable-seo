Here are the top 3 recommendations:

1. **The Infortrend EonStor GSe Pro 3000**: This unified SMB storage system is ideal for businesses planning for future data growth with flexible deployment needs. Its cloud integration, scale-out expansion up to 16PB, and modular host board slots make it a top choice for businesses with growing storage needs.
2. **The Buffalo TeraStation 5810DN**: This 8-bay 10GbE NAS is built for fast, secure business storage with cloud sync and Active Directory integration. Its quad-core CPU with ECC RAM and hot-swap drives make it a great choice for businesses requiring high-performance storage.
3. **The Synology FS3600**: This 24-bay all-flash NAS delivers high-performance I/O-intensive enterprise workloads, making it perfect for databases, VMs, and OLTP applications. Its 12-core CPU and high-speed networking capabilities make it a top choice for businesses requiring high-performance storage.

I chose these three products because they offer a balance of performance, scalability, and features that cater to businesses with growing storage needs. The Infortrend EonStor GSe Pro 3000 offers flexibility and scalability, while the Buffalo TeraStation 5810DN provides high-performance storage with cloud sync and Active Directory integration.
