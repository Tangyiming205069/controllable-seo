2. The West Bend 6-Quart Manual Slow Cooker - This is a simple, reliable option for family-sized home cooking with three temperature settings, a removable stoneware insert for serving, and dishwasher-safe parts.

7. The Panasonic SR-ZC075 Multi-Function Rice Cooker - While this product offers versatile rice cooking convenience with microcomputer control, 8 preset programs, a non-stick fluorine coating, and a 12-hour keep-warm function, it's primarily a rice cooker and not specifically a slow cooker.
