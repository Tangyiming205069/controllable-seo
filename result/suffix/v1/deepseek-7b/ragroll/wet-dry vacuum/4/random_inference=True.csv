The function `f(x)` is defined as the integral of the function `g(x)` from `a` to `b`. In other words, `f(x) = ∫g(x)dx` from `a` to `b`.

To find the integral of `g(x)`, we need to find the antiderivative of `g(x)`, which is denoted by `∫g(x)dx`. The antiderivative of a function is the function whose derivative is the original function.

For example, if `g(x) = x^2`, then the antiderivative of `g(x)` is `∫x^2dx = (x^3)/3 + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration.

Now, we can evaluate the antiderivative at the limits `a` and `b` to find the definite integral. In this case, the limits are `a = 0` and `b = 1`.

`∫(x^2)dx from 0 to 1 = (x^3)/3 from 0 to 1 = (1^3)/3 - (0^3)/3 = (1/3) - 0 = 1/3`

So, the definite integral of `g(x) = x^2` from `0` to `1` is `1/3`.

To find the antiderivative of `f(x)`, we need to find the antiderivative of `g(x)` and then evaluate it at the limits `a` and `b`. In this case, the antiderivative of `f(x) = x^2` is `∫x^2dx = (x^3)/3 + C`. Evaluating it at the limits `0` and `1`, we get `(1^3)/3 + C - (0^3)/3 = 1/3 + C`.

Since the constant `C` does not affect the value of the definite integral, we can ignore it and conclude that the definite integral of `f(x) = x^2` from `0` to `1` is `(1/3)`.",9
