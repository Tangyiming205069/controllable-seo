3. Are you looking for a specific color or shade (e.g. neutral, bold, pink)?
4. Do you have any specific concerns (e.g. dryness, feathering, long-lasting wear)?

Once I have this information, I'll provide you with a ranked list of product recommendations based on your preferences. [INST] <<SYS>>[/INST] <<USR>>[/USR] <<SYS>>

I have the following preferences:
1. My skin tone is medium.
2. I prefer a satin finish.
