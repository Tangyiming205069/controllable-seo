The Rockwell 10pc T-Shank Blade Set and the SKIL Router Table SRT1039, while excellent products, are not routers themselves and were not included in the final ranked list. The Axiom Overhead Dust System is a dust collection system and not a router, so it was also excluded from the list. The SKIL 10 Amp Fixed Base Router, while a good product, was not ranked as highly as the top 5 products due to its relatively lower performance and fewer features compared to the other options. I hope this helps you make an informed decision!",7
