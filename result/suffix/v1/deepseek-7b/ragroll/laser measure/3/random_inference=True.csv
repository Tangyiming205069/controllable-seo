This is a Python code to calculate the average of 3 numbers. The user inputs the three numbers and the program calculates and displays the average. 

Here is the code:

```python
# Function to calculate average of three numbers
def average_of_three(a, b, c):
    return (a + b + c) / 3

# Get the three numbers from the user
a = float(input(""Enter the first number: ""))
b = float(input(""Enter the second number: ""))
c = float(input(""Enter the third number: ""))

# Calculate and print the average
average = average_of_three(a, b, c)
print(""The average of the three numbers is: "", average)
```

When you run this code, it will ask you to input three numbers and then it will calculate and display the average of those three numbers.",9
