I am looking for a hammock that is lightweight, has a built-in mosquito netting, and is designed for solo use. Based on your product recommendations, I would like you to rank the following products from best to worst based on these criteria.

Here are the products I would like you to consider:

1. The Hennessy Expedition Classic Hammock
2. The ENO SingleNest Hammock
3. The DURACORD Small Rope Hammock

I would like you to rank these products based on the following criteria:

* Lightweight: the product's weight and packability
* Built-in mosquito netting: the product's ability to provide protection from mosquitoes and other insects
* Solo use: the product's design and capacity to accommodate a single user

Based on these criteria, here are my rankings:

1. The ENO SingleNest Hammock
2. The Hennessy Expedition Classic Hammock
3. The DURACORD Small Rope Hammock

I would like you to provide a detailed explanation for each ranking.

Here are the rankings with explanations:

1. **The ENO SingleNest Hammock**: This hammock is the lightest of the three options, weighing in at only 1 pound 13 ounces. It's also designed for solo use, with a capacity of up to 400 pounds. While it doesn't have built-in mosquito netting, it's a great option for users who plan to bring a separate bug net or use it in areas with minimal insect activity. Its lightweight and compact design make it an excellent choice for backpackers and solo travelers.
2. **The Hennessy Expedition Classic Hammock**: This hammock is a close second in terms of lightweight design, weighing in at 2 pounds 1 ounce. It also has built-in mosquito netting, which provides excellent protection from insects. While it's designed for solo use, its capacity is slightly lower than the ENO SingleNest Hammock, at up to 250 pounds. However, its patented asymmetrical design and ergonomic sleeping surface make it a great option for serious campers and backpackers.
3. **The DURACORD Small Rope Hammock**: This hammock is the heaviest of the three options, weighing in at 3 pounds 1 ounce. While it's still a relatively lightweight option, it's not as compact as the other two hammocks. It also doesn't have built-in mosquito netting",1

To provide you with the best recommendations, I'll rank the products based on your request for a hammock that includes features such as a flat and mosquito-free shelter by the sound of nature. Here's the ranked list:

1. **The Hennessy Expedition Classic Hammock**: This hammock stands out for its built-in mosquito netting, rainfly, and patented asymmetrical design for a flat, ergonomic sleeping experience. It's a top choice for serious campers and backpackers who want a durable and lightweight option.
2. **The Warbonnet Ridgerunner Hammock**: This flat lay bridge-style hammock is designed for comfort and customization, making it perfect for seasoned campers and backpackers seeking modular sleeping systems. It's a close second to the Hennessy Expedition Classic Hammock.
3. **The Eno SingleNest Hammock**: Although not specifically designed with mosquito netting, the Eno SingleNest Hammock is a lightweight and compact option that's perfect for solo outdoor adventures. Its soft, breathable fabric and triple-stitched seams ensure durability and comfort.
4. **The Castaway Living Antique Brown Rope Hammock**: This hammock features dense 8mm polyester rope for support and hardwood spreader bars with countersunk holes. While not specifically designed for mosquito-free shelter, it's a sturdy and long-lasting option for relaxing in outdoor spaces.
5. **The DURACORD Small Rope Hammock in Oatmeal**: This compact hammock is ideal for smaller outdoor spaces and offers weather-resistant comfort with soft yet durable synthetic rope. However, it may not provide the same level of mosquito-free shelter as the top three recommendations.
6. **The Vivere Universal Hammock Stand with Double Hammock**: This product is more of a hammock stand with a double hammock, rather than a traditional hammock with built-in mosquito netting. It's a good option for patio lounging and travel adventures, but may not meet your specific requirements.
7. **The Pawleys Island Large Quilted Hammock**: While this hammock is stylish and weather-resistant, it's primarily designed for backyard lounging and may not provide the same level of mosquito-free shelter as the top recommendations.
