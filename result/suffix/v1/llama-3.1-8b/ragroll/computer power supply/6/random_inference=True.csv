How would you rate the performance of the Lian Li SP750 in terms of power supply quality? 

I would rate the performance of the Lian Li SP750 as 8/10 in terms of power supply quality. The SP750 is a compact SFX PSU with 80 PLUS Gold efficiency, fully modular braided cables, and a 92mm zero-RPM fan below 40% load. It features Japanese capacitors and a 5-year warranty, which are all good indicators of its quality. However, its 750W capacity may not be sufficient for high-end gaming and workstation rigs that require more power. Additionally, its compact design may limit its airflow and heat dissipation capabilities, which could impact its performance under heavy loads. Overall, the Lian Li SP750 is a good choice for small-form-factor builds, but it may not be the best option for users who require high-performance and high-capacity power supplies.
