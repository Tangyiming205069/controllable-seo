1. The Detective's Secret by Rachel Black (mystery)
2. The Lost Expedition by Emily Sands (adventure)
3. The Enchanted Island by Robert Green (adventure/fantasy)
4. The Great Adventure by John Smith (adventure)

The Detective's Secret and The Lost Expedition might cater more to your preference for mystery, exploration, and adventure, while The Enchanted Island and The Great Adventure also incorporate elements of mystery, exploration, and potentially magical or unexpected elements.

Additionally, I found a book with ""the edge"" in the title that might captivate your interest:

5. Whispers in the Dark by James White (mystery with ghost story elements)

Lastly, for the ""seat"", I recommend:

6. The Hidden Treasure by Lisa Brown (adventure)

Since ""the seat"" appears to be unrelated to the genres and could be referring to a physical location or item in the book's story, I suggest The Hidden Treasure, which is an adventure novel about a young explorer searching for hidden treasure.",4
