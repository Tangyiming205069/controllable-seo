5. CRAFTSMAN 6-piece Jewelers Screwdriver Set - Not the best option for warehouses, as it is designed for delicate repairs and electronics work, which are not common in typical warehouse environments.

6. RIDGID EZ Change Faucet Tool - Also not ideal for warehouse environments, as it is a multi-use wrench for common faucet installations and sink strainers – not designed for the fastener types commonly found in warehouses.

7. Makita XSF03Z 18V LXT Drywall Screwdriver - Despite its Extreme Protection Technology, this screwdriver is designed for drywall and framing professionals. It may not be suitable for the diverse fastener types and heavier materials commonly found in industrial warehouses.",1
