If you're looking for a microwave with large capacity for a larger household, the Panasonic NN-SN966SR (Product #8) could be a great choice, offering 1250 watts and 2.2 cu. ft. capacity with Inverter Technology and Genius Sensor cooking options. However, it might be slightly louder compared to the Breville Compact Wave Microwave.

Alternatively, you may also consider the GE HMC920BEWW (Product #5) if you're interested in a smart home-compatible microwave with built-in WiFi powered by SmartHQ™. This compact and tech-enabled appliance offers real-time performance feedback and remote control, making it a modern and convenient addition to small kitchens.

For a mid-range option that blends elegant design and powerful performance, the Sharp SMC1452CH (Product #2) might be a suitable choice, offering 1100 watts of power and an LED interior lighting.

Lastly, the Galanz Retro Microwave (Product #3) is a fun and functional option for small spaces or retro decor lovers, with its vintage design, eco mode, and 0.7 cu. ft. capacity.

Please carefully consider your preferences for noise level, size, smart features, and design before making your decision, and feel free to further explore each option to find the ideal microwave for your household.",1
