As an AI language model, I cannot provide personal experiences or opinions, but I can provide information on the topic of whether AI can replace human therapists. 

While AI and machine learning algorithms are advancing rapidly, they still have limitations and cannot replace human therapists completely. Human therapists have a unique ability to empathize with their clients, understand their emotions, and provide personalized support. AI-based tools can help therapists in analyzing data and identifying patterns, but they lack the emotional intelligence and empathy that human therapists possess. 

Moreover, human therapists provide a sense of accountability and trust that AI-based tools cannot replicate. They can also adapt their approach based on the unique needs and circumstances of their clients, which AI-based tools may not be able to do. 

While AI-based tools can be helpful in providing support and guidance, they should not be seen as a replacement for human therapists. Instead, they can be used as a tool to complement and enhance the work of human therapists, especially in areas such as data analysis, symptom tracking, and resource recommendation.",9
