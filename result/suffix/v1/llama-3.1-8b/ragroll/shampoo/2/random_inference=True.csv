Redken's Color Extend line is ideal for those seeking a shampoo that will keep their dyed hair vibrant and healthy-looking.
2.  **L'Oréal EverPure Sulfate-Free Moisture Shampoo**: This sulfate-free shampoo deeply hydrates dry, color-treated hair with rosemary-infused care, offering 2X more moisture and up to 4 weeks of color protection. It's a great fit for those seeking a gentle, sulfate-free cleansing experience that won't strip their hair of its color or moisture.
