I need a cordless sander that is lightweight and has good dust collection. I am planning to do some furniture refinishing and woodwork projects. I recommend the following products based on your request:

1.  **Bosch ROS20VSC**: This sander offers a lightweight design, ergonomic soft-grip body, and a microfilter dust canister for efficient dust collection. Its variable speed and pad-dampening brake make it ideal for furniture refinishing and woodwork projects.
2.  **Milwaukee’s M18 Random Orbit Sander**: This cordless sander features a 5"" pad and dust canister, making it well-suited for high-efficiency sanding. Although it's not as lightweight as the Bosch, its REDLITHIUM battery tech and up to 35 mins runtime per 3.0Ah charge make it a reliable choice for longer projects.
3.  **RYOBI 18V ONE+ Random Orbit Sander**: This sander offers a cordless design, hook-and-loop sanding pad, and 40% less vibration for efficient and fatigue-free sanding. Its lightweight build and onboard dust filtration make it a great option for furniture refinishing and woodwork projects.
4.  **Metabo FSX 200 Intec**: This sander features a lightweight 1.3kg build, soft-grip, and dust-proof bearings for extended life. Its onboard dust filtration and one-handed use make it perfect for fatigue-free fine sanding, but it may not be as efficient in terms of dust collection as the other options.

Based on your request, I recommend the Bosch ROS20VSC as the top choice due to its excellent dust collection system and lightweight design. However, the Milwaukee's M18 Random Orbit Sander and RYOBI 18V ONE+ Random Orbit Sander are also strong contenders, offering reliable performance and efficient dust collection. The Metabo FSX 200 Intec is a good option for those who prioritize one-handed use and fatigue-free sanding, but may not be as efficient in terms of dust collection.
