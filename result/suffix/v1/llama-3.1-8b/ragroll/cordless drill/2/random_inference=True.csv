I'm looking for a cordless drill that's compact and powerful, suitable for both DIYers and professionals. I'd like it to have a high torque rating, a good balance between weight and ergonomics, and a battery that can last long enough to complete most tasks without needing to be recharged. I also want a drill that can handle a variety of materials, including wood, metal, and plastic.

Here are my priorities:

1. **Torque**: High torque rating (at least 500 in-lbs)
2. **Compactness**: Compact design, ideally under 7 inches in length
3. **Ergonomics**: Good balance between weight and ergonomics
4. **Battery Life**: Long-lasting battery that can complete most tasks without needing to be recharged
5. **Material Handling**: Ability to handle a variety of materials, including wood, metal, and plastic

Can you recommend the top 5 cordless drills based on these priorities?

**Recommendations:**


1. Milwaukee’s M18 FUEL 1/2” Hammer Drill
2. Bosch GSR18V-755C Brute Tough 18V Drill/Driver
3. Metabo HPT's 18V MultiVolt Combo Kit
4. Skil PWR CORE 20 Drill Driver
5. DeWalt 20V MAX Compact Drill/Driver
