## Step 1: Determine the key factors for ranking the barbecue grills
To rank the barbecue grills according to their portability, price, and features, we need to identify the key factors that are most important for camping, couples, and travelers. These factors include portability, ease of use, cooking space, and price.

The Broil King Baron S 490 PRO IR is the most affordable grill, with a lower price point.

I'd be happy to help you rank the products based on their suitability for camping. Here's the list with scores out of 10 and explanations for each product:

1. **The MiniMax Big Green Egg**: 9/10
The MiniMax Big Green Egg is a compact ceramic grill that's perfect for camping. Its small size and lightweight design make it easy to transport, and its ceramic construction ensures it can withstand the elements. It's also a great option for couples who want to enjoy meat on the go.

2. **The Blackstone 17"" Tabletop Griddle**: 8.5/10
The Blackstone 17"" Tabletop Griddle is another great option for camping. Its portable design and compact size make it easy to transport, and its H-style burner provides even heat for great cooking results. However, it's not as durable as some of the other options, so it might not withstand rough camping conditions.

3. **The Char-Broil 4-Burner Gas Grill**: 6/10
The Char-Broil 4-Burner Gas Grill is a great option for backyard grilling, but it's not as suitable for camping. It's a bit too large and heavy for easy transportation, and its gas-powered design might not be as convenient for camping.

4. **The Kamado Joe Classic Joe II**: 5.5/10
