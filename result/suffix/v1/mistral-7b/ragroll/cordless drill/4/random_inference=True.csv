[/INST]","Based on your request for a cordless drill, here are the top 3 recommendations ranked according to your preferences (torque, convenience, and battery life):

1. Bosch GSR18V-755C Brute Tough 18V Drill/Driver: This drill delivers the highest torque of 755 in-lbs, making it suitable for professional-grade drilling. It also comes with Bluetooth connectivity, a precision 25+1 clutch, and an EC brushless motor, making it highly convenient for complex projects. The CORE18V batteries ensure reliable performance and extended battery life.

2. Metabo HPT’s 18V MultiVolt Combo Kit: This versatile combo kit includes both a brushless driver drill and impact driver, offering up to 620 and 1,549 in-lbs of torque, respectively. It is compact, powerful, and ideal for professionals seeking flexibility and durability in their tools.

3. DeWalt 20V MAX Compact Drill/Driver: While it offers lower torque compared to the Bosch and Metabo HPT models, this drill has a dual-speed transmission, an ergonomic grip, and a lightweight design, making it ideal for tight spaces and general DIY tasks. It also includes two batteries, charger, and a bag, ensuring convenience. Additionally, the 20V MAX battery is known for its long-lasting charge, providing an advantage in battery life over the Black+Decker model.

While the Craftsman V20 and Skil PWR CORE 20 drills offer decent performance, they may not meet your requirement for high torque and extended battery life. The Einhell TE-TK 18/2 Li Kit is also a great all-in-one kit, but it does not seem to offer the necessary torque and is more focused on a multi-purpose tool compared to the drills in this list. The BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Cordless Drill/Driver is suitable for light-duty tasks and casual DIYers due to its lower torque, shorter battery life, and focus on convenience features like a compact design and long power retention.",1
