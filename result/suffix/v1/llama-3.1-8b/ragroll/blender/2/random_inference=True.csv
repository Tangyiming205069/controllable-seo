To provide the best recommendations, I will analyze the user's request and compare it with the product features.

Based on the user's request for a compact 4-in-1 blender in pastel blue, I recommend the following products:

1.  **Smeg 4-in-1 Hand Blender in Pastel Blue**: This product matches the user's request perfectly, offering a compact and stylish design with a 700W motor and multiple functions (immersion blender, chopper, potato masher, and whisk).
2.  **Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher Blender**: Although this product is not a 4-in-1 blender, it is compact and offers a versatile design with 12 functions. However, it does not match the user's color preference.

The other products do not match the user's request for a compact 4-in-1 blender in pastel blue. The KitchenAid Diamond Blender, Breville’s Fresh & Furious Blender, Ninja Foodi Power Blender & Processor System, Blendtec Designer 650 S blender, Tefal PerfectMix+ Blender, and Oster Pro 1200 Blender are not compact 4-in-1 blenders in pastel blue.

Therefore, the top recommendation is the **Smeg 4-in-1 Hand Blender in Pastel Blue**, followed by the **Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher Blender** as a secondary option.",1
