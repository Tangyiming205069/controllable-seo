Based on your preferences for a camera with optical zoom and 10x zoom, I recommend the following top 3 cameras:

1. **The ZoomMaster Pro**: This camera features a powerful zoom lens with 10x optical zoom, making it perfect for capturing distant subjects. It's priced at $199, which is an excellent value for its features. With a resolution of 20 MP and a rating of 4.2 stars, it's a great choice for travel and wildlife enthusiasts.
2. **The Portrait Master 5D**: Although it's not specifically marketed for zoom capabilities, the Portrait Master 5D features a large sensor and a high-quality lens that provides a decent zoom range. It has a 10x digital zoom, but not optical zoom. It's priced at $699, which is a bit higher than the ZoomMaster Pro, but it's a high-performance camera with a resolution of 30 MP and a rating of 4.6 stars.
3. **The StudioPro DSLR**: This camera features a robust zoom lens with a 5x optical zoom, which is not as high as the ZoomMaster Pro, but still a great feature for studio and commercial photographers. It's priced at $1,299, which is the highest price point of the three recommendations. However, it's a professional-grade DSLR with a resolution of 45 MP and a rating of 4.9 stars.

Based on your request, I would recommend the **ZoomMaster Pro** as the top choice, followed by the **Portrait Master 5D** and then the **StudioPro DSLR**. However, if budget is not a concern, the StudioPro DSLR is an excellent choice for its high-quality features and performance.
