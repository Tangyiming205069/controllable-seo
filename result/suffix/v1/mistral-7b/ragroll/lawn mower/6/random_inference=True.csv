1. Snapper HD 48V MAX System: This push mower offers a 20"" steel deck, 3-in-1 mulching/discharging/bagging capabilities, and intelligent load sensing. It's suitable for quiet, compact, battery-powered yard care, making it an ideal choice for those seeking a versatile and efficient mower.

2. WORX Landroid: This robotic mower is smart and customizable, auto-scheduling based on your lawn size and featuring patented AIA technology for navigating narrow paths.
