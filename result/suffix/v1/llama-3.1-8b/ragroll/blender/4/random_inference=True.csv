To provide you with the most relevant recommendations, I'll consider your preferences for a blender. Based on your request, I've ranked the products according to your priorities:

1. **Basic home use**: Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher Blender (Rank 1) - This blender is perfect for families and individuals who need versatile, on-the-go blending with a compact footprint.
2. **Whole footprint**: Smeg 4-in-1 Hand Blender (Rank 2) - This multi-functional blender is ideal for compact kitchens and everyday meal prep, with a sleek design and adjustable speeds.
3. **Premium performance**: Blendtec Designer 650 S blender (Rank 3) - This high-end blender boasts a 1560W motor, touchscreen controls, and 8 manual speeds, making it perfect for prosumers seeking premium performance and modern design.

The other products, while excellent choices, didn't quite fit your top priorities. The KitchenAid Diamond Blender is a great choice for those who value precision and durability, but it may not be the best fit for basic home use. The Breville’s Fresh & Furious Blender and Tefal PerfectMix+ Blender are both high-quality options, but they may not offer the same level of premium performance as the Blendtec Designer 650 S blender. The Ninja Foodi Power Blender & Processor System is a great all-in-one kitchen solution, but it may be overkill for basic home use. The Oster Pro 1200 Blender is a solid choice, but it may not offer the same level of power and features as some of the other options.

I hope this helps you find the perfect blender for your needs!",4
