Assistant: ","4x - 3y = 10

1. Multiply both sides of the equation by the multiplicative inverse of the coefficient of y, which is 3:
4x * 3 = 10 * 3

2. Simplify:
12x = 30

3. Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 12:
12x / 12 = 30 / 12

4. Simplify:
x = 2.5

5. Substitute the value of x back into the original equation to find the value of y:
4(2.5) - 3y = 10

6. Simplify:
10 - 3y = 10

7. Add 3y to both sides of the equation:
3y = 0

8. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for y:
y = 0/3

9. Simplify:
y = 0

So the solution to the system of equations is x = 2.5 and y = 0.",9
