Based on your request, I have ranked the products from 1 to 8 according to their suitability for car surface cleaning. The MTM Hydro PF22 Foam Cannon is the top recommendation due to its high pressure and foam coverage, followed by the Stanley FATMAX Gas Pressure Washer and the DEWALT DWPW2400. The Kärcher K5 Premium and the Westinghouse WPX2700 are also good options, while the Generac 2900 PSI Gas Pressure Washer and the Mi-T-M CD-1002-3MUH are more suitable for general outdoor cleaning. The Stihl RE 90 is the least recommended for car surface cleaning due to its lower pressure and narrower spray patterns.",1
