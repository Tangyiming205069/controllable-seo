[/INST]","Based on your request for a leaf blower that emphasizes maneuverability, here are my top three recommendations ranked in order:

1. **The RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Blower**: This lightweight and compact device is designed for quick, maneuverable cleanup tasks. It delivers 200 CFM at 90 MPH optimized for hard surfaces, and its cordless convenience gives it the mobility and ease of use that you're looking for. An added advantage is that it includes a battery, charger, and tools right out of the box.

2. **The WORX TURBINE electric blower**: Although this blower is ideal for high-capacity residential leaf clearing, its lightweight design (6.4 lbs) and variable speed control make it highly maneuverable. Its Hyper-Stream nozzle also aids in quick and efficient leaf blowing.

3. **The DeWalt 20V MAX Brushless Handheld Blower**: Despite its power and airflow capabilities (450 CFM and 125 MPH), this product is lightweight and ergonomic, making it easy to maneuver during yard work. Its variable speed trigger and speed lock feature also offer controlled airflow.

For larger properties with heavy debris, some of the more powerful backpack blowers like the STIHL BR 800 X MAGNUM or the Poulan Pro PR48BT might be more suitable, but they may not be as maneuverable due to their size and additional weight. The BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Sweeper is a good option for light, quick yard touch-ups and cleaning hard surfaces, but it might not be as effective for leaf blowing.",9
