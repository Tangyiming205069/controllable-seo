I'm looking for a lipstick that provides long-lasting, smudge-proof, and comfortable wear. I also want it to be hydrating and have a precise applicator. Based on your analysis, I recommend the following top 3 lipsticks:

1.  **Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick**: This lipstick delivers long-lasting, smudge-proof matte color with a full-pigment formula and precise applicator. It's also comfortable and customizable, making it perfect for all-day wear.
2.  **NARS Audacious Lipstick**: This lipstick provides single-stroke, satin-finish coverage in bold, long-lasting shades. Its creamy texture hydrates while preventing feathering, making it ideal for statement lips with luxurious feel and intense pigment.
3.  **Maybelline Super Stay Matte Ink**: This lipstick lasts up to 16 hours with a no-transfer formula and arrow applicator. It offers intense matte color and a flawless finish for all-day confidence, making it a great option for those who want a long-lasting, smudge-proof lipstick.

All three of these lipsticks meet your requirements for long-lasting, smudge-proof, and comfortable wear, and also offer hydrating and precise applicator features. However, if you're looking for a more precise applicator, Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick might be the best option for you. If you prefer a satin finish, NARS Audacious Lipstick could be the way to go. And if you're looking for a long-lasting, smudge-proof lipstick with a no-transfer formula, Maybelline Super Stay Matte Ink is a great choice.

7. **Revlon ColorStay Matte Lite Crayon**: This product is ranked seventh due to its smudge-proof, water-resistant matte lipstick with mango seed oil and precise crayon with built-in sharpener, but its 30% lighter formula might not be as impressive as the top-ranked products.
8. **MAC Love Me Lipstick**: Ranked eighth, this product infuses argan oil for all-day moisture with a weightless, satin finish, but its lack of long-lasting formula and precise applicator might make it less desirable compared to the top-ranked products.
