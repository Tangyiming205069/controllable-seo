I'd be happy to help you evaluate the products and provide a ranked list of recommendations. Here's a rewritten review for each product, along with a recommendation ranking:

**Rank 1: Fractal Design’s Ion+ Platinum PSU**
The Fractal Design’s Ion+ Platinum PSU is an exceptional choice for those seeking a premium, low-noise PC build. Its custom 140mm fan ensures silent operation, while the UltraFlex modular cables and 80 PLUS Platinum efficiency provide top-notch performance. The 10-year warranty adds an extra layer of security, making this PSU a top recommendation for users who value reliability and quiet operation.

**Rank 2: Be Quiet’s Straight Power 11 750W PSU**
The Be Quiet’s Straight Power 11 750W PSU is a great option for users seeking silence and stability. Its 80 PLUS Gold efficiency, Silent Wings 3 fan, and modular cables make it an excellent choice for those who value quiet performance. The premium capacitors and wire-free DC design add to its appeal, making this PSU a close second in our rankings.

**Rank 3: The MSI MPG gaming PSU**
The MSI MPG gaming PSU is a solid choice for users who require efficient and quiet power delivery. Its fully modular design, 80 PLUS Gold efficiency, and 10-year warranty make it a reliable option for gaming systems. However, it falls short of the top two recommendations due to its slightly lower efficiency and less premium features.

**Rank 4: Gigabyte’s fully modular 80+ Gold PSU**
The Gigabyte’s fully modular 80+ Gold PSU is a good option for users seeking efficient and quiet PC builds. Its compact design, 5-year warranty, and full suite of protections make it a reliable choice. However, its 90% efficiency and semi-fanless mode are not as impressive as the top three recommendations.

**Rank 5: The FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W**
The FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W is a solid choice for users who require high-efficiency performance under harsh conditions. Its 80 PLUS Platinum efficiency, conformal coating, and ECO fan mode make it a reliable option. However, its lack of premium features and shorter warranty compared to the top three recommendations place it lower in our rankings.
