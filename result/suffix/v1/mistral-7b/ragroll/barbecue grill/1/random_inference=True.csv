[/INST]","Based on your interest in a tailgating-style griddle, I have ranked the recommended products below:

1. Blackstone 17"" Tabletop Griddle: This product stands out as it delivers the compact size and portability you are looking for, along with an H-style burner that ensures even heat distribution. Its hood and Rear Grease Management System simplify cleanup, making it a suitable option for outdoor cooks seeking a tailgating-style griddle.

2. Char-Broil 4-Burner Gas Grill: Although this isn't a griddle, it is a great choice if you're open to considering grills with a griddle-like surface (gridirons or griddle plates). It offers a 10,000 BTU side burner that can be used as a high-heat griddle, combining the performance you need for both grilling and tailgating.

3. Weber Spirit E-310 Gas Grill: While it lacks a griddle surface, its large cooking space and user-friendly design make it a great option for family meals and casual grilling. You could consider purchasing a separate griddle attachment for tailgating purposes.

4. Pit Boss Classic Pellet Grill: This pellet grill doesn't come with a griddle surface but offers 8-in-1 versatility from 180 degrees Fahrenheit to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, making it suitable for various cooking methods. For tailgating, you may opt for using a dedicated griddle or griddle-style cast iron pan for cooking.

5. Kamado Joe Classic Joe II: As a ceramic charcoal grill, it doesn't have a griddle surface. However, you can still use it for tailgating by employing indirect heat cooking techniques. For achieving a griddle-like cooking surface, you may consider using a flat, heat-resistant surface, such as a cast iron skillet, inside the grill.

6. Traeger Pro 780: This wood pellet grill does not have a griddle surface, so it is not the ideal choice if you prefer a griddle-style cooking surface for tailgating. However, it offers WiFIRE® app control,",1
