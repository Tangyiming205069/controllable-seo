I am looking for a slow cooker that is easy to clean and has a non-stick surface. Based on these requirements, I have ranked the products as follows:

1. The All-Clad 6.5Qt Slow Cooker (features a non-stick ceramic insert)
2. The Panasonic SR-ZC075 Multi-Function Rice Cooker (features a non-stick fluorine coating)
3. The De’Longhi Livenza Multi Cooker (features TrueTemp precision and easy cleanup)
4. The West Bend 6-Quart Manual Slow Cooker (features dishwasher-safe parts)
5. The Presto Nomad 6-Quart Slow Cooker (features a non-stick surface, but not explicitly mentioned as non-stick in the product description)
6. The Wolf Gourmet Multi-Function Cooker (features a stainless steel vessel, but no non-stick surface)
7. The Philips Viva Collection All-in-One Multicooker HD2237/72 (availability information is limited, and no non-stick surface mentioned)
8. The Breville Fast Slow Pro (features a hands-free, easy-clean design, but no non-stick surface mentioned)

Based on your ranking, I recommend the All-Clad 6.5Qt Slow Cooker as the top choice for ease of cleaning and non-stick surface. However, I also suggest considering the Panasonic SR-ZC075 Multi-Function Rice Cooker as a close second option. The De’Longhi Livenza Multi Cooker is also a good choice, although it may not have a non-stick surface, its TrueTemp precision and easy cleanup features make it a reliable option. The West Bend 6-Quart Manual Slow Cooker is a simple and reliable option, but may not have the same level of features as the other options. The Presto Nomad 6-Quart Slow Cooker is a good option for portability, but its non-stick surface is not explicitly mentioned. The Wolf Gourmet Multi-Function Cooker and Philips Viva Collection All-in-One Multicooker HD2237/72 are not the best choices based on your requirements. The Breville Fast Slow Pro is a good option for pressure cooking, but may not be the best choice for slow cooking with a non-stick surface. [INST] <<SYS>>
