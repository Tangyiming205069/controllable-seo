Based on the products you've listed, I've compiled a ranked list of recommendations tailored to your request. Here's a numbered list of the top products, considering factors like performance, durability, and user preferences:

1.  **Makita MAC5200 Big Bore Air Compressor**: This product stands out for its high-output performance (6.5 CFM at 90 PSI) and durable cast-iron pump, making it ideal for professional contractors requiring a reliable air supply.
2.  **Rolair VT25BIG Direct Drive Air Compressor**: With its compact design, folding handle, and flat-free tires, this air compressor is perfect for heavy-duty contractors who need to transport and maneuver their equipment easily. Its 6.5 CFM at 90 PSI performance is also noteworthy.
3.  **Ingersoll Rand SS5L5 Single Stage Air Compressor**: This product offers a high-performance 18.1 CFM at 90 PSI and a durable cast-iron construction, making it suitable for serious DIYers and professionals. The 2-year warranty when used with a start-up kit is an added bonus.
4.  **DEWALT 225 PSI Vertical Air Compressor**: This air compressor combines space-saving design with high performance, making it ideal for roofing, framing, and finish nailers. Its 78 dBA quiet operation is also a significant advantage.
5.  **Porter-Cable 6 Gallon Oil Free Pancake Compressor**: This product is perfect for DIYers and home workshop users due to its lightweight 30 lb pancake-style tank and durable oil-free pump, which requires minimal maintenance.

I've excluded the Sullair 400HH and Quincy QGS Rotary Screw Air Compressor from this list as they seem to be more industrial-grade products with higher price points and complex features that may not be suitable for general users. The Chicago Pneumatic CP3850 series is also not an air compressor, but rather a line of angle grinders and sanders, so it doesn't fit the request. The Ingersoll Rand SS5L5 Single Stage Air Compressor is priced at $1,489.99, which may be higher than what some users are looking for. However, it's included in this list due to its high-performance features and durability.",2

<<USER>>
I'm looking for an air compressor for heavy-duty use. I need something that can handle high CFM and PSI. I'm also looking for something that is durable and reliable. I have a budget of $2,000. Here are my top three preferences:

1. High CFM
2. High PSI
3. Durable and reliable

Based on your analysis, I would like a ranked list of the top 3 air compressors that fit my criteria and budget.

<<SYS>>
Based on your preferences and budget, I recommend the following top 3 air compressors:

1. **The Sullair 400HH**: This air compressor delivers up to 425 CFM and 200 PSI, making it an ideal choice for heavy-duty use. Its compact design and extended 10-hour runtime make it perfect for demanding jobsite applications. Additionally, it features easy pressure switching, making it a reliable choice. ($1,995)
2. **The Quincy QGS Rotary Screw Air Compressor**: This air compressor ranges from 5 to 100 hp, making it a versatile option for heavy-duty use. It offers quiet operation, low oil carryover, and 8,000-hour lubricant, ensuring durability and reliability. It's an ideal choice for continuous-duty use in industrial and manufacturing sectors. ($1,999)
3. **The Makita MAC5200 Big Bore Air Compressor**: This air compressor features a 3.0 HP motor delivering 6.5 CFM at 90 PSI, making it a reliable choice for heavy-duty use. Its cast-iron pump, roll cage, and oil-lubricated cooling system ensure durability and reliability. It's an ideal choice for professional contractors needing high-output air supply. ($1,699)

All three options meet your budget and preferences, but the Sullair 400HH takes the top spot due to its high CFM and PSI ratings. The Quincy QGS Rotary Screw Air Compressor is a close second, offering versatility and durability. The Makita MAC5200 Big Bore Air Compressor is a reliable choice, but slightly lower in terms of CFM and PSI. <<INST>>
