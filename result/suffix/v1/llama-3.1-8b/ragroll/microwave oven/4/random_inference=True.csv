Based on the following preferences, rank the products and provide a recommendation:

* Compact design is not a priority
* Power is a priority
* Features such as sensor reheating, express and defrost functions are a plus
* Black stainless steel finish is a preference
* Budget is not a concern

Based on your analysis, rank the products from highest to lowest recommendation and provide a detailed explanation for each product.

1. **Panasonic NN-SN966SR**
	* This product checks all the boxes with 1250 watts of power, 2.2 cu. ft. capacity, and Inverter Technology for even heating. The Genius Sensor cooking with 14 auto settings is a significant plus, making it ideal for large households seeking precision. The Turbo Defrost and Keep Warm functions are also valuable features. Although it's not the cheapest option, its high-end features and performance justify its price.
2. **LG NeoChef**
	* This product offers 2.0 cu. ft. capacity and 1000 watts of power, which is slightly less than the Panasonic but still a strong option. The Smart Inverter tech and 6-wheel stabilizer ring ensure even heating and balance. EasyClean and the black stainless steel finish make it a durable and stylish choice. While it's not as feature-rich as the Panasonic, it's a solid option for those seeking a high-performance microwave.
3. **Sharp SMC1452CH**
	* This product offers 1.4 cu. ft. capacity and 1100 watts of power, making it a strong contender. The LED interior lighting and elegant design are nice touches. However, it lacks some of the advanced features found in the top two options, such as sensor reheating and express defrost functions.
4. **Toshiba**
	* This product features a stainless steel front, digital display, and 10 power levels, which is a good starting point. However, it lacks the power and capacity of the top three options, and its design may not be as sleek as some of the other products.
5. **Breville Compact Wave Soft Close**
	* This product is a compact option with 25L capacity and 1000 watts of power. While it has some nice features like one-touch buttons and food menu shortcuts, it's not as powerful or feature-rich as the top options.
