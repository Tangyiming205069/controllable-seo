Additionally, it has a unified SMB storage system with strong data protection features, including deduplication and QoS automation.
2. **Fujitsu ETERNUS AF250 S3**: This product stands out in performance with up to 600K IOPS and 99.9999% uptime. It also offers deduplication, QoS automation, and failover support, making it a top choice for Tier-1 applications in mid-sized enterprises. Its scalability is also impressive, with up to 8,110 TB capacity.
