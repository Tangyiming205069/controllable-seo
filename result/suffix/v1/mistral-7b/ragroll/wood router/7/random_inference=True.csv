1. Bosch MRF23EVS 2.3 HP Fixed-Base Router: This router offers a powerful 15 Amp motor, Constant Response circuitry, and microfine depth adjustment, making it a comprehensive choice for any woodworking project. While it doesn't have an integrated dust collection system, it can be easily adapted with a separate dust extraction system.

2. Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router: This cordless router delivers impressive power (31,000 RPM) through its brushless motor, matching the performance of 1.25 HP corded routers. It also features micro and macro depth adjustments, dual LED lighting, and a compact design for efficient working in a well-organized workspace.

3. Makita RT0701C Compact Router: This router offers a 1-1/4 HP motor with variable speed range, and a slim ergonomic body. It has a smooth rack-and-pinion depth adjustment, ensuring precision in your woodworking tasks. Although it doesn't come with an integrated dust collection system, it is designed with ease of integration with external dust extraction solutions.

While the SKIL Router Table SRT1039 and Axiom Overhead Dust System were not included in this list, they may be valuable additions to your workshop for increased efficiency in terms of onboard bit storage and dust collection, respectively. The Rockwell 10pc T-Shank Blade Set and WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router were not prioritized in this list due to their focus on blade replacements and plunge routing, which may not meet your need for a fixed-base router for heavy-duty woodworking projects.

[/INST]","I'm sorry for any confusion, but it appears there seems to be a mix-up in your request and the provided list. You asked for wood router recommendations, and I've prepared a list of the products you provided, but reorganized them according to the number of horsepower (HP) they claim to have:

1. Bosch MRF23EVS 2.3 HP Fixed-Base Router
2. The Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router delivers 31,000 RPM with a POWERSTATE Brushless Motor, matching 1.25 HP corded routers
3. RIDGID 1-1/2 HP Compact Router
4. Makita RT0701C Compact Router offers 1-1/4 HP
5. The SKIL 10 Amp Fixed Base Router's power cannot be directly compared to horsepower, but it's approximately 7.46HP (10 Amp x 0.746 HP/amp) according to simple power conversion calculations

For your convenience, I've also added the following accessories that can be useful for woodworking:

1. WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router - This router can handle both 1/4 and 1/2-inch bits and offers a wider range of speed settings (8,000–23,000 RPM)
2. Rockwell 10pc T-Shank Blade Set - This blade set is versatile for blade swaps without tools and is compatible with the BladeRunner X2
3. Axiom Overhead Dust System - Ensures efficient dust collection with minimum 500 CFM airflow when used with Axiom CNC routers.

Hope this helps! If you have any questions or need more assistance, please let me know.",4
