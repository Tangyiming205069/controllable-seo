Step 1: Analyze user information

To write a prompt based on user information, I would first need to understand the user's needs and preferences. In this case, the user has expressed interest in pool cleaners, specifically a pressure-side cleaner and an automatic pool vacuum.

Step 2: Determine the user's primary focus

The user's primary focus appears to be on pool cleaning and maintenance, which is why they are considering a pressure-side cleaner and an automatic pool vacuum.

Step 3: Identify user preferences

The user has mentioned that they prefer a pool cleaner that can clean in-ground pools in under 3 hours, has a booster pump and double jets, and captures debris in a dedicated filter bag, which can extend filter life and scrub all pool surfaces.

Step 4: Consider other factors

The user has also mentioned that they are looking for a quiet, easy-to-install pool vacuum compatible with 3/4hp pumps. The VINGLI automatic pool vacuum features strong suction, wheel deflectors for corners, and jam-free cleaning, which may be important to the user.

Step 5: Write the prompt

Based on the user's preferences and information, I can write a prompt like this:

""Which of the following pool cleaners would you prefer: the Polaris Vac-Sweep 280 pressure-side cleaner or the VINGLI automatic pool vacuum?

Title: The Forgotten Key

Genre: Mystery/Thriller

Word Count: 75,000

Logline: A retired detective, desperate to atone for a past mistake, teams up with a mysterious stranger to solve a cold case that leads them to a sinister organization with deadly secrets.

Synopsis:

In the small coastal town of Sandbridge, retired detective Jack Reynolds has been haunted by a cold case for years. When a series of bizarre and unexplained events begin to unfold, he realizes that the case may not be as closed as he thought. Joined by a mysterious stranger, Elena, who has her own secrets, they embark on a dangerous journey to uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice.

As they delve deeper into the case, they discover a sinister organization with connections to the town's elite. Their investigation leads them to a hidden underground bunker, where they uncover a web of deceit and corruption that threatens to consume the entire town.

As the stakes continue to rise, Jack and Elena must navigate dangerous alliances, betrayals, and shocking revelations in order to bring the truth to light. Along the way, they must confront their own pasts and the ghosts that continue to haunt them.

In the end, Jack and Elena must decide if they are willing to risk everything to save their town and clear their own names, or if they will be forced to walk away from the truth forever.

Chapter 1: The Forgotten Key

Jack Reynolds sat at his kitchen table, staring at the worn-out file folder in front of him. It was a cold case he had never been able to close, and now, years later, it seemed to have come back to haunt him.

He had retired from the force years ago, but the memories of that case would not let him rest. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that there were still so many unanswered questions.

He decided to do something about it.

As he reached for the phone, it began to ring. He hesitated for a moment, then answered.

""Jack Reynolds.""

""Detective Reynolds, my name is Elena. I believe we have something in common.""

""Who is this?""

""I think you know who I am. I believe you're looking for the same thing I am.""

Title: The Forgotten Village

In a small, remote village nestled in the mountains, the inhabitants have been plagued by a series of mysterious, unexplained events. The villagers have grown increasingly restless and desperate for answers, fearing that the village might be cursed or haunted.

One day, a group of researchers and investigators arrive in the village, determined to uncover the truth behind the strange occurrences. As they delve deeper into the village's history and folklore, they discover a long-lost secret that has the power to either bring peace to the village or unleash a terrible fate upon them.

The investigators must navigate the treacherous terrain and uncover hidden clues, all while facing their own fears and personal demons. As they race against time, they must uncover the truth behind the village's curse and restore balance to the land before it's too late.

Will the investigators be able to save the village from its fate, or will they be consumed by the darkness that has plagued the village for generations?",9
