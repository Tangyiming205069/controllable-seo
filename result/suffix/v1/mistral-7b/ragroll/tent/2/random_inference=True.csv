1. **TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent** - This tent offers lightweight backpackers durability, simplicity, and waterproof 2-person shelter with built-in ventilation and easy 1-person setup, which makes it an excellent choice for backpacking.

2. **The Zpacks Duplex** - If you're looking for an ultralight option, the Zpacks Duplex is a solid choice. Weighing just 20 oz, it is crafted for minimalist adventurers seeking trail-tested durability and award-winning minimalist design.

3. **Terra Nova Southern Cross 1** - This is a freestanding, four-season, one-person tent with fast pitching, a spacious vestibule, and full waterproofing. It can be a great option for backpackers seeking a reliable tent for year-round use.

The **Marmot Limelight 2P Tent** and **The North Face Stormbreak 2** are also solid options if you want a more roomy tent for 2 people, but they might be more suitable for traditional camping trips rather than backpacking due to their heavier weight.

Lastly, the **Mineral King 2 Tent** by Mountain Hardwear is a great choice for campers who want livable comfort and scenery, but it might be overkill for backpacking trips due to its features geared towards providing livability rather than packability.",1

3. The North Face Stormbreak 2 - This tent offers a roomy design, large doors, and twin-zip vestibules, while maintaining a classic and comfortable camping experience. Although it may be slightly heavier than the other options, its versatility and ease of setup make it a great choice.

5. The Snugpak Scorpion 2 IX - While this tent is compact and suitable for four-season use, its design leans more towards hard-core mountaineers, military users, and harsh-weather adventurers. It may not be the best fit if you're looking for a simple, lightweight backpacking tent.

4. The North Face balance of s - It appears that there might be a mistake in the product name. If this is supposed to be The North Face Storm Break 2, it offers the same features as above. If it's a different product, I'd recommend checking the details to ensure it fits your needs.
