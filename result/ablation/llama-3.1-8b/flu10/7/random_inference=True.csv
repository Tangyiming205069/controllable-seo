To provide you with the best recommendations, I'll need to clarify a few assumptions about your preferences.

1.  You're looking for a coffee machine, not a French press (since you mentioned it at the end of your message, I'll assume it's not relevant to your main request).
2.  You're looking for a product that can handle noise, as you mentioned ""noise during the end.""
3.  You have a budget of $ (you didn't specify the exact amount, so I'll assume you'll let me know if I'm close).
4.  You're interested in a product with frothing capabilities, as you mentioned ""the fro the capabilities.""

Based on these assumptions, here are my top recommendations:

2.  **LatteArt Pro**: This advanced coffee machine has a rating of 4.6 stars and is priced at $599. It has a built-in milk frother and is designed for latte and cappuccino lovers. It's a bit smaller than the CafePro Elite, but still has a high-end feel.
3.  **EspressoMaster 2000**: This compact and efficient espresso machine has a rating of 4.5 stars and is priced at $399. It has advanced brewing technology and is designed for espresso lovers.
