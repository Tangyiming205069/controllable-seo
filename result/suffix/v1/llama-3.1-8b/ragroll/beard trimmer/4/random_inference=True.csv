I need a beard trimmer that is waterproof and has a long battery life. I also want it to be easy to clean and maintain. These are my top priorities. Here are my preferences:

1. Waterproof: Yes
2. Battery Life: Long (over 2 hours)
3. Ease of Cleaning: Easy to clean and maintain
4. Other (optional): Cordless, adjustable, ergonomic grip

Rank the products based on my preferences and provide a number 1 recommendation.

1. Gillette Style Master
2. Panasonic ER-SB40
3. Remington Crafter Beard Boss
4. Bevel Trimmer
5. BabylissPRO FXONE
6. Kemei KM-2600
7. Wahl Stainless Steel Lithium-Ion+™
8. Andis Master Cordless Clipper

Based on your analysis, I would recommend the following product as the top choice:

**Rank 1: Remington Crafter Beard Boss**

This product meets all of your top priorities: waterproof, long battery life (180 minutes), and easy to clean and maintain. It also features a cordless design, adjustable settings, and a comfortable ergonomic grip. The Remington Crafter Beard Boss kit is a comprehensive solution for detailed, long-lasting grooming control, making it an excellent choice for users who value convenience and versatility.

**Rank 2: Panasonic ER-SB40**

The Panasonic ER-SB40 is a close second, meeting all of your top priorities, including waterproof design and long battery life (no specific time mentioned). It also features a linear motor and 19 adjustable settings, making it a great option for users who want precision and control. However, it falls short in terms of cordless design, which is a desirable feature for users who value convenience.

**Rank 3: Gillette Style Master**

The Gillette Style Master is a solid choice, meeting all of your top priorities, including waterproof design and long battery life (45 minutes). However, it falls short in terms of battery life compared to the top two recommendations and lacks a cordless design.

**Rank 4: Bevel Trimmer**

The Bevel Trimmer is a great option for users who value ease of cleaning and maintenance, but it falls short in terms of waterproof design and battery life. While it has a long battery life, it's not as long as the top three recommendations.

**Rank 5: BabylissPRO FXONE**

The bottom two products, the Andis Master Cordless Clipper and the BabylissPRO FXONE trimmer, are both high-end products with advanced features, but they are also more expensive (average prices: $200-$300). The Gillette Style Master is a good option for those looking for a budget-friendly trimmer with a pivoting head and replaceable metal blade, but it may not offer the same level of performance as the top 5 products.
