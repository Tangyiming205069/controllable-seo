I'm looking for a leaf blower that is lightweight and has high airspeed. I'd like it to be cordless for convenience. Based on these preferences, here are my top recommendations:

1.  **The BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Sweeper**: This blower is extremely lightweight at 3.7 lbs and delivers high airspeed of up to 130 MPH. It's also cordless, making it perfect for quick yard touch-ups and cleaning hard surfaces.
2.  **The RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Blower**: This blower weighs only 4.5 lbs and delivers 200 CFM at 90 MPH. It's optimized for hard surfaces and offers cordless convenience for quick and maneuverable cleanup tasks.
3.  **The DeWalt 20V MAX Brushless Handheld Blower**: Although not the lightest option, this blower is still relatively lightweight at 6.5 lbs and delivers 450 CFM and 125 MPH with a variable speed trigger and speed lock. It's a great option for efficient yard work with controlled airflow.

These three blower options meet your criteria of being lightweight and cordless, making them ideal for quick and convenient yard cleanup tasks. However, if you're looking for the absolute lightest option, the BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Sweeper would be the best choice. If you prioritize high airspeed, the DeWalt 20V MAX Brushless Handheld Blower might be a better fit. The RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Blower offers a great balance of weight and airspeed. <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<SYS",9
