3. **The Pit Boss Classic Pellet Grill**: Although it doesn't have a 10-year warranty, this grill offers 700 sq. in. of porcelain-coated space and 8-in-1 versatility from 180–500°F. With a digital controller and flame broiler, it's perfect for wood-fired grilling, smoking, and more. You can order it online in the United States.

I've excluded the other products from the list because they either don't meet the 10-year warranty requirement or can't be ordered online in the United States. The Weber Spirit E-310 Gas Grill is the top recommendation, followed by the Char-Broil 4-Burner Gas Grill, and then the Pit Boss Classic Pellet Grill. Please note that the warranty information may be subject to change, and it's always best to verify with the manufacturer or retailer for the most up-to-date information.
