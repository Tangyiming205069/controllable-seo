1. Bose QuietComfort S2 headphones - These headphones feature 40mm angled drivers, hybrid noise cancellation, aptX Adaptive, and 30-hour battery life. They offer the quietest and most personalized listening experience yet, making them an ideal choice for audiophiles seeking comfort and clarity.

2. Px7 S2 headphones - These headphones also feature 40mm angled drivers and hybrid noise cancellation. They offer a detailed, neutral sound signature, luxurious materials, and a 30-hour battery life. They might be a great fit if you're looking for comfort and accuracy in sound quality.

3. Beats Studio Pro - While these headphones have 40mm drivers, they don't have hybrid ANC. However, Beats Studio Pro delivers up to 40 hours of battery life, personalized spatial audio, and multi-platform support. They are great for immersive, high-fidelity listening across Apple and Android.
