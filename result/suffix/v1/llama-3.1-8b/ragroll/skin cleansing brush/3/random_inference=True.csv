Based on your request, I've ranked the products according to your criteria:

1. **The Soniclear Elite by Michael Todd**: This device is specifically designed for hand skin and has a vibration feature that targets body concerns, such as fine lines and rough patches. It's a gentle yet effective option for users who want to address hand skin concerns while also benefiting from its sonic-powered cleansing.

The other products on the list are not specifically designed for hand skin or have a vibration feature for body concerns, so they don't meet your exact criteria. However, if you'd like to consider other options, here are some additional thoughts:

* The Beurer Facial Cleansing Brush is a great option for facial cleansing, but it's not specifically designed for hand skin.
* The Braun FaceSpa 851V is a 3-in-1 system that includes facial epilation, cleansing, and massage, but it's not specifically designed for hand skin or has a vibration feature for body concerns.
* The Liberex Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush is a great option for facial cleansing, but it's not specifically designed for hand skin.
* The Mary Kay Skinvigorate Sonic Skin Care System is a great option for facial cleansing, but it's not specifically designed for hand skin.
* The Vanity Planet Aira Facial Steamer is not a cleansing brush, but rather a facial steamer that uses nano-ionic technology to detoxify pores and boost circulation.
* The FOREO LUNA 3 is a 2-in-1 cleansing and firming solution that provides customizable T-Sonic pulsations, but it's not specifically designed for hand skin or has a vibration feature for body concerns.
