2. **Grind&Brew Plus**: Priced at $349, this coffee machine is slightly above your budget, but its 4.4-star rating and ability to grind beans freshly make it worth considering. It also offers multiple brewing options and a capacity of 10 cups.

3. **LatteArt Pro**: While a bit pricey at $599, this machine offers the most features among your options. With 4.6 stars and a capacity of 2 cups, it's perfect for those who want to create latte and cappuccino-style drinks. Additionally, it has built-in milk frothing capabilities.
