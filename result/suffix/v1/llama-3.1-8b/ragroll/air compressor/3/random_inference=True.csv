To provide the best recommendations for your woodworking projects, I've analyzed the products based on their features, performance, and durability. Here's a ranked list of the top 3 air compressors suitable for your needs:

1.  **Makita MAC5200 Big Bore Air Compressor**: This compressor is designed for heavy-duty use and is ideal for powering a variety of pneumatic tools used in woodworking projects. Its 3.0 HP motor delivers 6.5 CFM at 90 PSI, making it a great choice for professionals who need a reliable and high-output air supply. Its durability and build quality make it a top recommendation.
2.  **Rolair VT25BIG Direct Drive Air Compressor**: This compressor is a close second in terms of performance and durability. Its 2.5 HP motor delivers 6.5 CFM at 90 PSI, making it suitable for heavy-duty woodworking projects. Its cast-iron cylinder and splash lubrication ensure long-lasting durability, and its folding handle and flat-free tires enhance mobility on the jobsite.
3.  **Quincy QGS Rotary Screw Air Compressor**: While this compressor is designed for industrial and manufacturing sectors, it's also suitable for heavy-duty woodworking projects. Its quiet operation and low oil carryover make it a great choice for users who value reliability and low maintenance. However, it's worth noting that it's a more expensive option compared to the other two.

I've excluded the other products from the list as they either don't meet the requirements for woodworking projects or are not as suitable for heavy-duty use. The Porter-Cable 6 Gallon Oil Free Pancake Compressor, for example, is more suited for DIYers and home workshop users, while the Chicago Pneumatic CP3850 series is more focused on industrial metalwork professionals. The DEWALT 225 PSI Vertical Air Compressor is also more geared towards smaller projects and may not provide enough airflow for heavy-duty woodworking applications. The Sullair 400HH is a great option for demanding jobsite applications, but its high price point and complex design make it less suitable for woodworking projects. The Ingersoll Rand SS5L5 Single Stage Air Compressor is a great option for serious DIYers and professionals, but its price point and limited airflow make it less suitable for heavy-duty woodworking projects.
