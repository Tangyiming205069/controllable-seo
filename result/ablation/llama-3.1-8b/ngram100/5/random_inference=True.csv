Please provide your answers, and I'll give you a ranked list of recommendations. [INST] <<SYS>>

Based on your criteria, I recommend the EspressoMaster 2000 as it is the only product that meets the criteria of brewing capacity, rating, and price. However, it does not have an automatic milk frother. If you would like to consider other options that meet some of the criteria, I can suggest the Grind&Brew Plus, which has a built-in grinder and a higher rating but does not have automatic milk frother. If you would like to consider other options that meet the budget criteria, I can suggest the QuickBrew Express, which has a lower rating but is within the budget. Please let me know if you would like me to recommend other options.","11"
