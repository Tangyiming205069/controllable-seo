I am looking for a portable speaker with good sound quality and long battery life. I am willing to spend up to $200. Here are my priorities:

1. Sound quality
2. Battery life
3. Durability
4. Portability
5. Price

Based on your analysis, I recommend the following products:

1.  **The soundcore 3 Bluetooth speaker** ($99.99)
	* Features dual titanium drivers for high-fidelity treble up to 40kHz, enhanced BassUp tech, 16W stereo sound, and 24-hour playtime.
	* IPX7 waterproofing and compact design make it ideal for outdoor listeners and long trips.
2.  **The Ultimate Ears BOOM 3** ($149.99)
	* Delivers balanced 360° audio with deep bass and 15-hour battery life in a rugged, waterproof IP67 build.
	* Covered in durable, two-tone performance fabric, it's designed for music lovers who want durability and premium sound on the go.
3.  **The Bose SoundLink Revolve II** ($199.95)
	* Offers immersive 360° sound with a down-firing transducer and dual passive radiators, up to 13 hours of playtime, and voice assistant access.
	* Water-resistant and impact-resistant, it's perfect for everyday carry and deep-listening experiences.

These products meet your priorities, offering excellent sound quality, long battery life, and durability. The soundcore 3 is the most affordable option, while the Ultimate Ears BOOM 3 and Bose SoundLink Revolve II offer more premium features and sound quality. The Marshall Emberton II is a close contender, but its price is slightly above your budget. The JBL Flip 6 and Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 7 are also good options, but they don't quite match the sound quality and battery life of the top three recommendations. The Tribit StormBox Micro 2 is a good option for those who want a rugged and portable speaker, but its sound quality is not as high-end as the top three recommendations.
