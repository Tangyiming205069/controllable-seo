Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo, powered by Bio-Nourish Complex, targets damaged hair and helps repair up to 98% of daily breakage, making it a go-to for users needing intense nourishment and restoration.  [/INST]","Based on your request for a shampoo that is sulfate-free, hydrating, and can help with detangling, here are my top three recommendations ranked according to their main features:

1. L'Oréal EverPure Sulfate-Free Moisture Shampoo - This shampoo deeply hydrates dry, color-treated hair with rosemary-infused care, offering 2X more moisture and up to 4 weeks of color protection. The sulfate-free formula makes it an ideal choice for those seeking gentle, sulfate-free cleansing.

2. Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo - This product locks in moisture without weighing hair down, delivering clinically proven healthier hair with every wash. It's a sulfate-free formulation that caters to those seeking intense hydration and a gentle, multitasking shampoo for their hair care routine.

3. The Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo - While it contains niacinamide, which can cause a foaming lather due to its surfactant properties, the main focus of this shampoo is to promote moisture, smoothness, and detangling without parabens or phthalates. This product is a great fit for those aiming to resist breakage and enhance hair strength.

With that said, the Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Shampoo and Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo are also suitable choices, especially for those who are looking for a deep moisturization or repair of damaged hair. However, they contain sulfates, which might be a consideration for some users. The Redken Color Extend line and Matrix Brass Off Shampoo are specifically designed for color-treated hair to nourish strands and protect color longevity. Lastly, the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo is vegan, paraben-free, and color-safe, but it might be priced a bit high for some users.",6
