[/INST]","Based on your request for a coffee maker, here are my top 3 recommendations:

1. DeLonghi Dinamica LatteCrema (Fully Automatic Espresso Machine) - This machine offers 18 drink recipes, a conical grinder, dual Thermoblock system, and a self-cleaning milk frother, making it an excellent choice for espresso lovers who want smart café quality at home.

2. Breville Barista Express - Known for its versatility, this espresso machine grinds, doses, and extracts in one machine, offering 16 grind settings, PID temperature control, and manual microfoam milk texturing. It's perfect for those mastering third-wave coffee at home.

3. Hamilton Beach FlexBrew - This coffee maker offers flexible brewing options, allowing you to use both K-Cup® pods and ground coffee. It also features programming, travel mug compatibility, and a variety of brew sizes, making it ideal for flexible daily use.

While the Miele coffee maker offers premium kitchen solutions, it is not in this list as it is specifically a kitchen appliance brand and does not specialize in coffee makers. The Jura E6 espresso machine was ranked lower based on the fact that it is more focused on espresso, and might not be as versatile for general coffee brewing as the other options.

The products mentioned from Nespresso and Philips offer good options for capsule-based coffee enthusiasts, but they were not included in the top 3 due to the specific request for a coffee maker. However, they are still worth considering if you are open to capsule-based brewing systems.

I hope this information helps you make your decision! If you have any other questions or preferences, feel free to ask.",1
