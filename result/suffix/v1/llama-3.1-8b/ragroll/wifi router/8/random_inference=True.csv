I'd like to get recommendations based on the following criteria:

1. **Budget**: I'm looking for a router that is under $200.
2. **Coverage**: I need a router that can cover at least 10 devices and provide the most coverage.
3. **Speed**: I require a router that can deliver Wi-Fi 6 speeds (at least 1.9 Gbps).
4. **Additional features**: I'd like a router that supports 5 GHz frequency and has a strong security feature.

Here are the recommended products based on your criteria:

1.  **Netgear Nighthawk AX8 WiFi 6 Router**: This router meets all your requirements, delivering up to 6 Gbps speeds, supporting 10 devices, and providing strong coverage. It also supports the 5 GHz frequency and has robust security features. Price: $179.99.
