If you were looking for a grinder rather than a Burr Grind Coffee Machine, I would suggest the following adjustments to my previous recommendations:

3. **Espresso Grinders like grindpro or grindmax**: These grinding systems are designed specifically for espresso roasters and cupping rooms and offer high-quality grind, grind adjustment and grind control for the perfect espresso shot.
4. ** grinder with grinding stones like grindrino or grindmaxx**: These grinder systems use grinding stones instead of burrs and offer a quieter and less heat generated grinding process

Hi!

I'm looking for a coffee machine that matches my budget and preferences. I have a limited budget of $100 and prefer a single-serve coffee maker with a smaller capacity (1-2 cups). I'd also like it to be easy to use and have a good customer review rating. Based on these criteria, I can you please recommend a few options?

Also, please consider the following preferences:

I'm a coffee lover and I appreciate a rich and strong cup of coffee.

I'm looking for something compact and space-efficient, so a machine that can fit easily in a small office or kitchen is a plus.

Finally, I'm not too concerned about advanced features such as frothing milk or latke options.
