To determine which coffee machine is right for you, consider the following factors:

1. **Brewing style**: Think about the type of coffee you like to drink. Do you prefer a strong and rich French press, or a smooth and refreshing cold brew?
2. **Capacity**: Consider how many cups you need to brew at once. If you're the only one drinking coffee, a single-serve machine might be sufficient. If you're brewing for a family or group, a larger capacity machine might be more suitable.
3. **Features**: Think about the features that matter most to you. Do you want a machine with a built-in grinder, milk frother, or advanced brewing technology?
4. **Budget**: Set a budget and stick to it. Coffee machines can range from under $50 to over $1,000, so it's essential to determine how much you're willing to spend.
5. **Space**: Consider the space you have available for the machine. Some machines are compact and perfect for small kitchens, while others are larger and more suitable for commercial use.

By considering these factors, you can narrow down your options and find the perfect coffee machine for your needs and preferences.

I'm looking for a coffee machine that is easy to use and has a good capacity. I'm willing to spend up to $200. My priority is ease of use, followed by capacity, and then price. Can you recommend some options for me?

Here is the ranked list of coffee machines based on your preferences:
