KitchenAid's dishwasher offers a FreeFlex™ Third Rack, Advanced Clean Water Wash, and ProWash™ Cycle. With 44 dBA quiet performance, fingerprint-resistant finish, and top controls, it's perfect for households wanting flexible, spotless cleaning in a sleek design.  [/INST]","Based on your preferences for versatility, affordability, smart control, and value, I recommend the following product:

1. Haier's ENERGY STAR® Smart Dishwasher

Haier's dishwasher offers the features you're looking for: it comes with WiFi connectivity via SmartHQ™, a sanitize cycle, and a stainless steel interior. This smart dishwasher provides performance, quiet operation, and smart control at a great value, making it the ideal choice for a top user seeking versatile, affordable, and smart dishwashing solutions.

For more premium options with various features:

2. Fisher Paykel’s Double DishDrawer™ dishwasher
3. KitchenAid's dishwasher
4. Miele dishwasher

These dishwashers offer innovative designs, versatile cleaning solutions, and superior performance. However, they may be more expensive compared to the Haier model. While the Fisher Paykel and Miele models focus on versatility and sleek designs, the KitchenAid dishwasher provides flexible, spotless cleaning in a sleek design with added features like the FreeFlex™ Third Rack and ProWash™ Cycle.

Lastly, for a compact dishwasher ideal for smaller spaces like apartments, condos, or offices, I recommend the Avanti 24"" dishwasher. It fits 12 place settings, offers 5 cycles, and operates quietly at 57 dBA. Although this dishwasher doesn't fall under your stated preferences for smart control, it is still an efficient and space-saving option.

For users with tough loads and long-term reliability, consider the Maytag dishwasher as it features Dual Power Filtration, PowerBlast® cycle, a full stainless steel tub, touch controls, and a 10-year warranty.",1
