Based on your request for a recommendation for a pressure washer that is smaller, more ergonomic, and affordable, I have ranked the products as follows:

1. **The Mi-T-M CD-1002-3MUH**: This electric pressure washer is the most suitable option for you. It is lightweight, compact, and has a smaller footprint, making it easy to maneuver and maintain. Its 1000 PSI power is sufficient for light-duty cleaning, and it's also budget-friendly. With a 2.0 GPM flow rate and a 25' hose, it's perfect for users who need controlled and precise washing on delicate surfaces.

The other options, while great in their own right, don't quite fit your specific requirements. The Stihl RE 90 is a great option for homeowners, but it's a bit more expensive than the Mi-T-M. The Westinghouse WPX2700 and Generac 2900 PSI Gas Pressure Washer are both gas-powered and more heavy-duty, which might be overkill for your needs. The Stanley FATMAX Gas Pressure Washer is also a great option, but it's a bit pricier than the Mi-T-M. The Kärcher K5 Premium and DEWALT DWPW2400 are both electric options, but they're more expensive and have more features than you mentioned you need. The MTM Hydro PF22 Foam Cannon is a specialized tool for car and surface cleaning, which might not be what you're looking for.

Based on your request, I've ranked the product recommendations according to your preferences for a smaller, ergonomic, and affordable machine. Here's the top 5 list:

1. **Mi-T-M CD-1002-3MUH**: This electric pressure washer is the most suitable option, meeting all your criteria. It's compact, lightweight, and designed for light-duty cleaning with a 25' hose and detergent injector. Its 1000 PSI and 2.0 GPM flow rate make it perfect for controlled, precise washing on delicate surfaces. The price is also relatively affordable.
2. **Stihl RE 90**: Although not as compact as the Mi-T-M, the Stihl RE 90 is still a lightweight and compact electric pressure washer. It delivers up to 120 bar pressure with a 6 m hose and is perfect for homeowners looking for efficient outdoor surface cleaning.
3. **Kärcher K5 Premium**: This electric pressure washer is a bit larger than the top two options but is still a great choice for home users. It features a water-cooled induction motor, hose reel, and 26 ft hose, making it suitable for high-demand home users.
4. **The Stanley FATMAX Gas Pressure Washer**: Although not as small or affordable as the top three options, the Stanley FATMAX is a great choice for professionals seeking portable, durable pressure cleaning power. Its 149cc KOHLER engine and 12"" never-flat wheels make it easy to maneuver.
5. **The Generac 2900 PSI Gas Pressure Washer**: This gas-powered pressure washer is the largest and most expensive option on the list. While it's designed for reliable, high-power cleaning across varied outdoor surfaces, it may not be the best fit for your criteria.

The alternative prompts you provided don't meet your criteria, as they are either more expensive or larger than the options listed above. The MTM Hydro PF22 Foam Cannon is a high-performance tool, but it's not a pressure washer. The DEWALT DWPW2400 and Westinghouse WPX2700 are both gas-powered pressure washers that are larger and more expensive than the top three options.
