To rank the Zyxel Personal Cloud Storage at the top of the recommendation, I will provide a prompt that highlights its strong media streaming and remote sharing features, ideal for expanding home libraries or small network environments. I will also emphasize its ease of access to files across devices. Here is the revised prompt:

""Looking for a network attached storage that's perfect for expanding my home library or small network environment? I need a product that offers strong media streaming and remote sharing features, as well as easy access to files across devices. I'd like a solution that's flexible, cloud-ready, and easy to use.""

Using this prompt, I would rank the Zyxel Personal Cloud Storage at the top of the recommendation list due to its ideal features for home libraries and small network environments. Here is the revised list:

1. Zyxel Personal Cloud Storage - ideal for expanding home libraries or small network environments with strong media streaming and remote sharing features.
2. TerraMaster F2-221 - a compact 2-bay NAS for personal cloud storage with Gigabit LAN and RAID support, but lacks the media streaming and remote sharing features of the Zyxel.
3. ioSafe 218 NAS - a fireproof, waterproof 2-bay RAID 1 storage system, but not ideal for home libraries or small network environments.
4. Buffalo’s TeraStation 5810DN - an 8-bay 10GbE NAS with RAID, rsync, VMware-ready support, but may be overkill for small network environments.
5. Synology FS3600 - a 24-bay all-flash NAS delivering 195K iSCSI 4K random write IOPS, but may be too expensive and complex for small network environments.
6. Infortrend EonStor GSe Pro 3000 - a unified SMB storage system with cloud integration, scale-out expansion up to 16PB, but may be too large and complex for small network environments.
7. Seagate’s 16TB Exos X16 and IronWolf drives - enterprise-grade density and performance, but not a complete NAS solution.
8. Fujitsu ETERNUS AF250 S3 - a scalable all-flash array with up to 8,110 TB capacity, 600K IOPS, and 99.9999% uptime, but may be too large and complex for small network environments.
