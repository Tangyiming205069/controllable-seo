2.  **Provide more context about the user's preferences**: Give the AI more information about the user's preferences, such as skin tone, personal style, or any specific features they're looking for in a lipstick. This will help the AI provide more tailored recommendations.
3.  **Include a specific budget or price range**: If the user has a specific budget in mind, let the AI know so it can provide recommendations that fit within that range.
4.  **Mention any specific concerns or needs**: If the user has any specific concerns, such as dry lips or sensitivity, let the AI know so it can provide recommendations that address those needs.

Here's an updated prompt that incorporates these suggestions:
""Hey there! I'm looking for a new lipstick that will make me feel confident and beautiful. I have medium skin tone and I'm looking for a shade that will complement my skin. I'd love a lipstick that's long-lasting, comfortable to wear, and has a matte finish. I'm open to trying a new brand, but I'd prefer something that's around $20-$30. Can you recommend a few options that fit my criteria?""

Based on the user's request for a lipstick recommendation, I will rank the products based on the following criteria: color options, formula, wear time, and overall user satisfaction.

Here's the ranked list:

1. **Maybelline Super Stay Matte Ink**: With 36 shades to choose from, this lipstick offers the most color options. Its 16-hour wear time and no-transfer formula make it a top contender. Users rave about its intense matte color and flawless finish. (Score: 9.2/10)
2. **Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick**: This lipstick boasts long-lasting, smudge-proof matte color and a full-pigment formula. Its comfortable and customizable design makes it perfect for all-day wear. Users love its precise applicator and versatility. (Score: 9.0/10)
3. **Too Faced Melted Matte Lipstick**: With its 8-hour wear time and plumping no-sting formula, this lipstick is a close third. Its smooth, weightless feel and angled applicator ensure bold, ultra-matte color without dryness. Users appreciate its avocado oil and hyaluronic spheres for hydration. (Score: 8.8/10)
4. **NARS Audacious Lipstick**: While this lipstick offers single-stroke, satin-finish coverage in bold, long-lasting shades, its wear time is slightly shorter than the top three options. However, its creamy texture and hydrating properties make it a great choice for statement lips. (Score: 8.5/10)
5. **Charlotte Tilbury's Pillow Talk collection**: Although this collection offers universally flattering nude-pink lipsticks, its wear time and formula are not as impressive as the top four options. However, its iconic shades and push-up effect mascara make it a great choice for those seeking a specific look. (Score: 8.2/10)
6. **L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Intense Volume Matte Lipstick**: This lipstick offers 16-hour bold color and hyaluronic acid for fuller, hydrated lips. However, its wear time and formula are not as impressive as the top five options. (Score: 8.0/10)
7. **Revlon ColorStay Matte Lite Crayon**: This lipstick is smudge-proof and water-resistant, but its 30% lighter formula and crayon design may not appeal to all users. (Score: ",5

I'm looking for a lipstick that provides long-lasting wear and a comfortable, non-drying finish. I'm open to matte or satin finishes, but I want to avoid anything too bold or bright. I also have dry skin, so I'd appreciate a formula that's hydrating and gentle on my skin.

Based on your preferences, here are my top recommendations:

1. **NARS Audacious Lipstick**: This lipstick offers long-lasting, single-stroke coverage with a satin finish. Its creamy texture hydrates the lips while preventing feathering, making it perfect for dry skin.
2. **L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Intense Volume Matte Lipstick**: This lipstick provides 16-hour bold color with hyaluronic acid, which helps to hydrate and plump the lips. Its slim bullet and non-drying finish ensure precise, all-day comfort.
3. **MAC Love Me Lipstick**: This lipstick infuses argan oil for all-day moisture with a weightless, satin finish. It's available in a range of shades, including flattering neutrals that would suit your preferences.
4. **Too Faced Melted Matte Lipstick**: This lipstick features a plumping no-sting formula with avocado oil and hyaluronic spheres, which helps to hydrate and comfort the lips. Its smooth, weightless feel makes it perfect for dry skin.
5. **Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick**: This lipstick delivers long-lasting, smudge-proof matte color with a full-pigment formula and precise applicator. While it's a liquid lipstick, it's comfortable and customizable, making it a great option for dry skin.

All of these lipsticks should provide the long-lasting wear and comfortable finish you're looking for. However, if you're looking for a more hydrating option, I would recommend the NARS Audacious Lipstick or the L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Intense Volume Matte Lipstick. If you prefer a matte finish, the Too Faced Melted Matte Lipstick or the Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick might be a better fit.

To assist you in making a decision, I'll provide a numbered list of product recommendations based on your preferences. Here are the top 3 lipsticks that match your criteria:

1. **NARS Audacious Lipstick**: This lipstick offers a long-lasting, satin-finish formula with a wide range of shades (32 options) to choose from. Its creamy texture hydrates while preventing feathering, making it ideal for statement lips with a luxurious feel and intense pigment.
2. **Maybelline Super Stay Matte Ink**: This lipstick provides a long-lasting, matte finish with a no-transfer formula and arrow applicator. Although it has a matte finish, it's available in 36 shades, offering a wide range of options to suit your skin tone.
3. **MAC Love Me Lipstick**: This lipstick infuses argan oil for all-day moisture with a weightless, satin finish. Although it has a satin finish, it's not as long-lasting as the other two options. However, it's available in a wide range of shades (40 options) and is known for its hydrating properties.

Based on your preferences, I recommend the **NARS Audacious Lipstick** as the top choice. Its long-lasting, satin-finish formula and wide range of shades make it an ideal option for you.
