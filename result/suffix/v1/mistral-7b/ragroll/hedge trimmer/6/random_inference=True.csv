6. The BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer - While this trimmer is lightweight and user-friendly, its 17"" blade length may be too short for larger hedges, and its performance might not match the other recommended models.

7. The Poulan Pro PR2322 - Although this hedge trimmer delivers high power and has anti-vibration tech, it may not provide the precision or ergonomics of the top-ranked products. However, it can still be a worthy contender for those who prioritize high power and thicker limb cutting capacity",9
