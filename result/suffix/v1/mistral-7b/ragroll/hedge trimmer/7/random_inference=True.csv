2. BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer - This trimmer has a lightweight build, T-handle, and full-length trigger, offering control and comfort for trimming smaller hedges and shrubs.

3. Snapper XD 82V Cordless Hedge Trimmer - Although this trimmer is slightly larger with 26"" steel blades, its rotating handle, reverse function, and brushless motor provide precision and control, making it suitable for maintaining smaller hedges.

7. DeWalt 20V MAX Hedge Trimmer - This trimmer is lightweight and powerful, but its size and power might be more than what's needed for small hedges, making it less suitable for your requirement.

It is lightweight and comes with a 5.0 Ah battery and charger, making it suitable for clean, fast landscape trimming with enhanced precision. The focus on precision and performance makes it a great choice for users seeking a high-quality hedge trimmer.

3. STIHL HS 82 T
   - Reasoning: This pro-grade hedge trimmer offers up to 5,100 strokes/min, providing the user with precise vertical and horizontal trimming. Despite being a professional-grade model, reduced vibration and ergonomic design ensure comfort during use. However, its ranking is slightly lower due to its heavier focus on professional use.

1. The STIHL HS 82 T: This professional-grade gas hedge trimmer offers up to 5,100 strokes/min and dual-sided blades that ensure precision for both vertical and horizontal trimming. Its 2-MIX engine provides high performance and reduced emissions, while its ergonomic design reduces vibration for greater user comfort. Additionally, it offers a speed of up to 5,100 strokes/min for efficient trimming.

2. The Husqvarna 122HD60 gas hedge trimmer: Featuring a long cutter bar and adjustable rear handle, this trimmer is ideal for precision hedge shaping. It also benefits from Husqvarna’s Smart Start® and LowVib® technology, ensuring an easy start and reduced vibration for a more comfortable trimming experience. The model's powerful engine provides a clean cut, while its long cutter bar ensures efficient trimming.

3. The Ryobi 22"" 18V ONE+ Hedge Trimmer: With a compact design and upgraded dual-action blades, this hedge trimmer offers efficient trimming with a 3/4"" cut capacity.
