Zalman TeraMax II 1200W vs Fractal Design Ion+ Platinum vs FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W

When it comes to selecting the best power supply for your high-performance gaming or workstation rig, it’s essential to consider various factors such as efficiency, cooling, and build quality. Here’s a comparison of three top-performing PSUs to help you make an informed decision:

1. Efficiency:

- Zalman TeraMax II 1200W: 80+ Gold certified, with a 92% efficiency rate.
- Fractal Design Ion+ Platinum: 80 PLUS Platinum certified, boasting an 94% efficiency rate.
- FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W: 80 PLUS Platinum certified, with an efficiency rate of 94%.

In terms of efficiency, all three power supplies are highly rated, with the FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W and Fractal Design Ion+ Platinum leading the pack.

2. Cooling:

- Zalman TeraMax II 1200W: 120mm FDB fan for quiet operation.
- Fractal Design Ion+ Platinum: Custom 140mm fan for silent operation.
- FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W: 140mm fan with ECO fan mode for noise reduction.

All three power supplies offer advanced cooling solutions, but the Fractal Design Ion+ Platinum and FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W stand out for their custom and ECO fan modes, ensuring optimal noise reduction.

3. Build quality:

- Zalman TeraMax II 1200W: Japanese capacitors and 10-year warranty.
- Fractal Design Ion+ Platinum: 100% Japanese capacitors and 10-year warranty.
- FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W: Conformal coating and 10-year warranty.

All three power supplies are built to last, with Japanese capacitors in each model. However, the FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W also benefits from conformal coating, offering additional protection against harsh conditions.
