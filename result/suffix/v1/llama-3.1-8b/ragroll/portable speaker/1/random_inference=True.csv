I'm looking for a portable speaker that's compact, water-resistant, and has a long battery life. Based on your analysis, here are my top recommendations:

1.  **The Tribit StormBox Micro 2**: This speaker is a great fit for your requirements. It's compact, water-resistant (IP67), and has a 12-hour battery life. Its 10W sound with deep bass via XBASS technology is impressive for its size.
2.  **The Ultimate Ears BOOM 3**: This speaker is also a great option, offering 15-hour battery life and a rugged, waterproof IP67 build. It delivers balanced 360° audio with deep bass, making it perfect for music lovers who want durability and premium sound on the go.
3.  **The Marshall Emberton II**: Although it's slightly larger than the Tribit, it offers over 30 hours of playtime and rich sound in a rugged design. It's a great option if you prioritize long battery life and iconic style.

I've excluded the other options because:

* The JBL Flip 6 is a bit larger and heavier than the other options.
* The Soundcore 3 has a shorter battery life (24 hours) compared to the top three recommendations.
* The Bose SoundLink Revolve II is larger and more expensive than the other options.
* The Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 7 is more focused on stylish portability and refined acoustics, which may not be the top priority for you.
