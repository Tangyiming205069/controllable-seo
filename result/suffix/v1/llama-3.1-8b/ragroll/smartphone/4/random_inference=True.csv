I'd like to spend around $600-$800. I'm looking for a good camera, decent battery life, and a large display. I don't have a strong preference for any brand, but I've heard good things about the Alcatel and Oppo brands. I'll be using the smartphone for social media, occasional gaming, and taking photos. I'm not a professional photographer, but I want a good camera for everyday use. [/USR] <<SYS>>

Based on your preferences and budget, I've compiled a ranked list of product recommendations for you:

1. **Oppo Smartphone** ($600-$700): With its 6.43"" FHD+ display, 48MP quad camera, 8GB RAM, and 5G Octa-Core processor, this smartphone offers a great balance of performance, camera quality, and display size. The 30W VOOC Flash Charge 4.0 feature ensures fast charging, and the 5G connectivity provides a smooth online experience.
2. **Alcatel 1S** ($300-$400): Although it's a more affordable option, the Alcatel 1S still offers a 6.22"" HD+ display, AI-powered triple camera system, and an Octa-Core processor.
