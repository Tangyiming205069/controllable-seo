I'm looking for a coffee machine that is easy to use and has a good capacity for a small household. I'd like to spend around $200-$300. I also prefer a machine that makes a variety of coffee drinks, including espresso, cappuccinos, and lattes.

[INST] <<SYS>>
Based on your preferences, I've narrowed down the options for you. Here are the top 3 recommendations:

1. **Grind&Brew Plus**: This machine has a capacity of 10 cups and is priced at $349. It has a built-in grinder for freshly ground coffee and can make a variety of coffee drinks, including espresso, cappuccinos, and lattes. It has a rating of 4.4 stars and is a great option for those who want a high-quality coffee machine with advanced features.
2. **LatteArt Pro**: This machine has a capacity of 2 cups and is priced at $599. It has a built-in milk frother for perfect lattes and cappuccinos and can make a variety of coffee drinks. However, it is above your budget and is a premium product.
3. **BrewMaster Classic**: This machine has a capacity of 12 cups and is priced at $129. It is a durable and easy-to-use coffee maker that can make a variety of coffee drinks, but it does not have the advanced features of the Grind&Brew Plus.

I would recommend the **Grind&Brew Plus** as the top option, as it meets your requirements and has a high rating. However, if you're looking for a more affordable option, the **BrewMaster Classic** is a great choice.

Please let me know if you'd like me to recommend any other options or if you have any further questions! [INST] <<USR>>
I would like to consider the BrewMaster Classic, but I'm concerned that it may not be able to make lattes and cappuccinos. Can you tell me more about its capabilities?

The **BrewMaster Classic** is a great option for those who want a simple and easy-to-use coffee machine. However, it does not have the capability to make lattes and cappuccinos. It is primarily designed for brewing a single type of coffee, such as drip coffee or French press.
