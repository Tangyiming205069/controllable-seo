I'd like to rank these shampoo products based on the following criteria: effectiveness in repairing damage, sulfate-free, and affordability.

Here's a ranked list from most suitable to least suitable based on your preferences:

1. **Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo**: This product is a top pick due to its exceptional ability to repair damaged hair, with up to 98% of daily breakage targeted. It's also sulfate-free, making it a great fit for those seeking gentle cleansing. Although it's a bit pricier, its effectiveness and gentle formula make it a worthwhile investment. (Effectiveness: 9/10, Sulfate-free: 9/10, Affordability: 7/10)
2. **L'Oréal EverPure Sulfate-Free Moisture Shampoo**: This product offers excellent moisture and color protection, making it a great choice for those with dry, color-treated hair. Its sulfate-free formula and affordable price point make it a close second to the Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo. (Effectiveness: 8.5/10, Sulfate-free: 9/10, Affordability: 8/10)
3. **Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo**: This product provides gentle, sulfate-free cleansing and locks in moisture without weighing hair down.

4. **Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Shampoo**: This product offers a paraben-free, sulfate-free formula with a coconut scent, making it a great choice for those seeking a gentle, moisturizing shampoo. However, its effectiveness in repairing damage is lower compared to the top three picks. (Effectiveness: 6.5/10, Sulfate-free: 9/10, Affordability: 8/10)
5. **Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo**: This product is a good choice for those aiming to fortify their hair with apple extract and niacinamide.
