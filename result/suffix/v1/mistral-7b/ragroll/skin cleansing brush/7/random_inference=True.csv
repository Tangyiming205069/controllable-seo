4. Shiseido Cleansing Massage Brush: Although it doesn't offer sonic or vibrational functions like the other options, its silky-soft bristles and gentle massage action promote microcirculation and skin vitality, which can help with cleansing and maintaining healthy skin. However, it might not provide the thorough cleaning of the other options on this list.

5. The Mary Kay 11ig1ate Sonic-incsp System: This system is similar to the Mary Kay Skinvigorate Sonic Skin Care System but provides additional information about its cleaning power. However, without specific details about the 60-second cleanse, I ranked it lower compared to the other products mentioned above.

1. Mary Kay Skinvigorate Sonic Skin Care System: This system offers 60-second sonic cleansing at three speeds, removing up to 4x more dirt and pollutants than hand cleansing, making it suitable for daily use on all skin types.

2. The Liberex Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush: While it does not explicitly state a 60-second sonic cleansing feature, its ultrasonic technology combined with a 30-second cycle should be equivalent to a 60-second sonic cleansing in total.

4. Soniclear Elite by Michael Todd: This product also offers sonic-powered face and body cleansing, but it does not state a specific 60-second cleansing feature. However, if you find its dermatologist-recommended technology suitable for your needs, it can improve fine lines, rough patches, and overall skin health across all skin types.

5.

However, if you're also interested in gentle facial massage for skin vitality, this brush caters to all skin types.

Keep in mind that your personal preferences, budget, and specific skin concerns are also essential factors when choosing the right skin cleansing brush for yourself.",1
