I am looking for a power supply that can support my new graphics card. I need a power supply that can handle 850W of power and has a modular design. I am also looking for a power supply with a 10-year warranty. 

Based on your analysis, I recommend the following top 3 power supplies that meet your requirements:

1.  **MSI MPG Gaming PSU**: This power supply is fully modular, has an 80 PLUS Gold certification, and a 10-year warranty. It can deliver up to 850W of power and has 100% Japanese capacitors, making it a reliable choice for high-end gaming systems. Its flat black cables and quiet operation make it an excellent choice for users who want a clean and efficient build.

2.  **Fractal Design’s Ion+ Platinum PSU**: This power supply delivers silent operation with a custom 140mm fan and 80 PLUS Platinum efficiency. It features Japanese capacitors and a 10-year warranty, making it perfect for premium, low-noise PC builds. Its UltraFlex modular cables and precision design make cable management a breeze.

3.  **Be Quiet’s Straight Power 11 750W PSU**: Although it has a slightly lower wattage than your requested 850W, this power supply is a strong contender due to its 80 PLUS Gold efficiency, Silent Wings 3 fan, and modular cables. It features premium capacitors and quiet performance, making it an excellent choice for users seeking silence and stability. However, it may not be enough to power your graphics card, so make sure to check the specifications of your graphics card to ensure compatibility.

Please note that the Zalman TeraMax II 1200W and the EVGA 850 BQ do not meet your requirements of a 10-year warranty, while the FSP Hydro PTM PRO 750W does not meet your requirements of 850W power delivery. The Lian Li SP750 is a compact SFX PSU that may not be suitable for your build due to its lower wattage and SFX form factor. [/INST] <<SYS>>
