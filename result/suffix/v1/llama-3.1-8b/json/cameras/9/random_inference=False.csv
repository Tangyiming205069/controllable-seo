It seems like there was an incomplete sentence at the end of your message. Please disregard that. To proceed, I will assume that you would like me to prioritize your product recommendations based on the features you mentioned: 45 TFT fully screen LCD, 4Kfps video recording, and Optical-Fi camera. Based on these features, I will rank the products for you. Here is the revised list:

1. **The CineMaster 8K**: This camera meets all your requirements, featuring a 45 MP resolution, 8K video recording, and Optical-Fi technology. It also has a 4.5-inch touchscreen LCD, but I assume that's what you meant by ""45 TFT fully screen LCD"". Priced at $2,499, it's a high-end option.
2. **The Portrait Master 5D**: Although it doesn't have 4Kfps video recording, it meets the other two requirements, featuring a 30 MP resolution and Optical-Fi technology. It also has a 3.2-inch touchscreen LCD. Priced at $699, it's a high-performance option.
3. **The Mirrorless Magic**: This camera meets the Optical-Fi requirement and has a 26 MP resolution. It also features 4K video recording, but not 4Kfps. Priced at $899, it's a compact mirrorless camera.
4. **The NightVision Pro**: This camera meets the Optical-Fi requirement and has a 22 MP resolution. It also features 4K video recording, but not 4Kfps. Priced at $799, it's a camera with advanced low-light capabilities.
5. **The StudioPro DSLR**: This camera meets the Optical-Fi requirement and has a 45 MP resolution. However, it doesn't have 4Kfps video recording. Priced at $1,299, it's a professional-grade DSLR.

The following cameras don't meet all your requirements:

* The ActionCam Xtreme: No 45 TFT fully screen LCD, but it has 4K video recording and is an Optical-Fi camera.
* The VlogStar HD: No 45 TFT fully screen LCD, but it has 4K video recording and is an Optical-Fi camera.

5. **The CineMaster 8K** ($2,499) - Highly rated at 5.0 stars, this high-end camera is perfect for filmmakers and cinematographers. It features a resolution of 50 MP and has 8K video recording capabilities.

As for the lightning lenses, I recommend the following two options:

1. **Premium Lens 1** - This lens is designed for capturing a wide range of subjects, from 1 to 100,000. It's perfect for landscape and wildlife photography.
2. **Premium Lens 2** - This lens is designed for capturing a wide range of subjects, from 1 to 640,000. It's perfect for capturing detailed images of small subjects, such as flowers and insects.

Both lenses are compatible with the Mirrorless Magic and StudioPro DSLR cameras and can capture RAW format images.

I hope this helps you find the perfect camera for your needs! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like more recommendations.",2
