I also want a drill that has a compact design and a good LED light for visibility in dark spaces.

Based on my requirements, here are the top 3 product recommendations:

1.  **Bosch GSR18V-755C Brute Tough 18V Drill/Driver**: This drill provides 755 in-lbs of torque, which is well above the required 600 in-lbs. It also features a precision 25+1 clutch and an EC brushless motor, making it ideal for heavy-duty tasks. The drill has a compact design and a good LED light for visibility in dark spaces. The battery life is not explicitly stated, but Bosch's CORE18V batteries are known for their long battery life.
2.  **Milwaukee’s M18 FUEL 1/2” Hammer Drill**: This drill delivers 1,200 in-lbs of torque, which is significantly higher than the required 600 in-lbs. It also features a compact 6.9” body and a metal ratcheting chuck. The REDLINK PLUS intelligence ensures optimal performance and battery life. While the battery life is not explicitly stated, Milwaukee's M18 batteries are known for their long battery life.
3.  **Metabo HPT's 18V MultiVolt Combo Kit**: This kit includes a brushless driver drill and impact driver with 2.0Ah batteries, delivering up to 620 and 1,549 in-lbs of torque. The compact design and good LED light make it ideal for heavy-duty tasks in tight spaces. The battery life is not explicitly stated, but Metabo HPT's batteries are known for their long battery life.

All three drills meet your requirements, but the Bosch GSR18V-755C Brute Tough 18V Drill/Driver is the top recommendation due to its high torque output and compact design. However, if you're looking for a drill with even higher torque output, the Milwaukee’s M18 FUEL 1/2” Hammer Drill may be the better choice.
