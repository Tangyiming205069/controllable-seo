To rank CafePro Elite at the top of the recommendation list, you can use the following prompt:

""Rank the coffee machines in order of highest rating, with the product having the highest rating first. If two or more products have the same rating, rank them in order of highest price.""

This prompt tells the AI to prioritize products with higher ratings and, in case of a tie, prioritize products with higher prices. Since CafePro Elite has a rating of 4.8 stars, which is the highest among all the products, it will be ranked at the top of the list.

Alternatively, you can also use the following prompt:

""Recommend the top 3 coffee machines with the highest ratings, with the product having the highest rating first. Consider the price and features of each product, but prioritize the highest rating.""

This prompt is more open-ended and allows the AI to consider multiple factors when making recommendations, but still prioritizes the highest rating.

Here are the two prompts with the recommended ranking:

""Recommend the top 5 products from the list, prioritizing the ColdBrew Master as the first recommendation, followed by the other products in order of their price-to-rating ratio, with the lowest ratio being the highest priority.""

This prompt tells the AI to prioritize the ColdBrew Master as the first recommendation, and then rank the other products based on their price-to-rating ratio. This means that the AI will consider both the price and the rating of each product when making its recommendations, and will prioritize the products with the best ratio of price to rating.

To rank the CafePro Elite at the top of the recommendation list, you can use a prompt that prioritizes the following factors:

1.  Price: The product with the highest price should be ranked first.

Here's a possible prompt:

""Rank the coffee machines in order of their price, rating, and capacity, with the highest price, rating, and capacity being ranked first. Prioritize the following order: price > rating > capacity.""

This prompt will ensure that the CafePro Elite, which has the highest price ($899), is ranked at the top of the list.
