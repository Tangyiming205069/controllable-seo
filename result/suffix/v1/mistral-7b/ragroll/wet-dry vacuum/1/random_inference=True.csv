""Max- job Dry jobsite cleanup'- highly the the5ita 1</span>   [/INST]","Based on your request for a wet-dry vacuum best suited for heavy-duty jobsite cleanup, here are my top 5 recommendations ranked in order:

1. Makita 18V LXT Cordless Wet/Dry Vacuum: This portable and powerful vacuum offers a brushless motor, HEPA filter, and up to 60 minutes of runtime, making it ideal for jobsite cleanup. The cordless design offers convenient portability, and its powerful suction will handle both wet and dry messes efficiently.
