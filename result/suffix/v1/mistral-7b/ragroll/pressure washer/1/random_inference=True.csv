[/INST]","Based on your request for a light-duty, easy-to-handle pressure washer, I would rank the following pressure washers from best to worst for your needs:

1. Stihl RE 90: This electric pressure washer is lightweight, compact, and easy to maneuver. It offers user-friendly controls and features necessary for efficient outdoor surface cleaning, making it an ideal choice for homeowners.

2. Mi-T-M CD-1002-3MUH: This electric pressure washer is appropriate for light-duty cleaning with a controlled and precise washing experience. Its enclosed 1.5 HP motor and 2.0 GPM flow rate are perfect for users who need to clean delicate surfaces.

3. Kärcher K5 Premium: The K5 Premium pressure washer offers quiet operation and a water-cooled induction motor, making it suitable for high-demand home users. It comes with a hose reel, DirtBlaster wand, and a 26 ft hose, but its 2000 PSI might be a bit too strong for light-duty cleaning.
