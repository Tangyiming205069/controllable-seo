1. Dreo Portable Space Heater: This heater uses 1500W PTC ceramic heating and delivers ultra-quiet 40dB operation with 65° oscillation. It can warm rooms in 3 seconds, making it perfect for efficient and peaceful home heating. It also comes with a remote control.

2. Pelonis 1500W Electric Oil Radiator Heater: This heater offers an adjustable thermostat, five heat settings, a 10-hour programmable timer, and a remote control. It provides efficient, low-surface-temperature radiant heat, making it quiet and safe for home use.

3. Honeywell 360° Surround Heater: This heater offers all-around warmth with 360° tip-over safety, overheat protection, and dual heat settings. While it may not be as quiet as the other two, it still provides safe and efficient heating for small to mid-sized rooms. Additionally, it offers 360° heating, which can help distribute the heat evenly.

If you're open to considering a more premium option, the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde heater could be a great choice. This device combines advanced HEPA H13 purification, catalytic destruction of formaldehyde, Air Multiplier™ technology, and smart app/voice control, delivering whole-room air quality and heating while staying relatively quiet.

1. Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater: This heater offers widespread oscillation, adjustable thermostat, and seven-hour timer, making it easy to maintain your desired temperature. Its elongated heating element and tower design give it a broad coverage suitable for medium-sized rooms.

2. Pelonis 1500W Electric Oil Radiator Heater: This heater features an adjustable thermostat, five heat settings, a 10-hour programmable timer, and remote control. Its oil-filled design ensures efficient and low-surface-temperature radiant heat, making it an energy-efficient choice for medium-sized rooms.

3. The Heat Storm Tradesman 1500W Infrared Heater: While this heater is designed for garages, workshops, and patios, its adjustable thermostat and 7-foot cord make it versatile enough for medium-sized indoor spaces. The infrared heat technology provides fast and efficient warmth to the areas it's directed towards, allowing for more targeted heating.

You may also find the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde an interesting option if you are looking for a versatile heater that also provides air purification and can double as a fan or cooler in the summer. However, keep in mind that it is designed for whole-room use and may be overkill for a medium-sized heating-only need. The Dreo Portable Space Heater is another option suitable for medium rooms, offering rapid heating at an ultra-quiet 40dB, but its smaller size and more basic features may not be as ideal for larger rooms. The De’Longhi TRRS0715E is a great choice for rooms needing long-lasting comfort, but it's a better fit for larger spaces due to its powerful 1500W heat output. Finally, the Dr. Infrared Heater DR-968 is recommended for large rooms seeking powerful, safe warmth, and is likely too powerful for medium-sized spaces.
