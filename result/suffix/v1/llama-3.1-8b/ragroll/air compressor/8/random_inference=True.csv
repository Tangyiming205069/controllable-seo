To provide the best recommendations based on your request, I'll evaluate each product according to your needs. Since you're looking for an air compressor, I'll focus on the following criteria:

1. **Power and Performance**: I'll consider the compressor's horsepower (hp), cubic feet per minute (CFM), and maximum pressure (PSI) to determine its suitability for your needs.
2. **Noise Level**: If you're planning to use the compressor in a residential area or a workshop, I'll prioritize models with lower noise levels.
3. **Durability and Maintenance**: I'll look for compressors with durable construction, easy maintenance, and long lifespan.
4. **Mobility and Portability**: If you need to move the compressor frequently, I'll recommend models with compact designs, lightweight construction, and easy-to-use handles.

Based on these criteria, here are my top recommendations:

1. **Sullair 400HH**: This compressor delivers up to 425 CFM and 200 PSI, making it ideal for demanding jobsite applications requiring high airflow and mobility. Its compact design and extended 10-hour runtime make it perfect for heavy-duty contractors.

To provide a ranked list of recommendations based on your request, I will consider the following factors:

1. Airflow and pressure: Higher airflow and pressure are preferred for demanding jobsite applications.
2. Portability: A lighter and more compact design is ideal for easy transport and storage.
3. Noise level: Lower noise levels are preferred for working in residential areas or shared workspaces.
4. Maintenance: Oil-free pumps and durable construction are preferred for easy maintenance and reduced downtime.
5. Budget: A more affordable option is preferred, but the quality and performance of the compressor should not be compromised.

Based on these factors, here is a ranked list of recommendations:

1. **Sullair 400HH**: This portable compressor offers high airflow and pressure, making it suitable for demanding jobsite applications. Its compact design and extended 10-hour runtime also make it ideal for heavy work and manufacturing.
2. **Makita MAC5200 Big Bore Air Compressor**: This compressor features a high-output air supply, durable cast-iron pump, and oil-lubricated cooling system, making it suitable for professional contractors.

I'm looking for an air compressor for a home workshop. I need something that's easy to use, quiet, and has a decent air flow. I'm willing to spend around $500-$700. Based on these requirements, here's my ranked list of top 5 recommendations:

1.  **Porter-Cable 6 Gallon Oil Free Pancake Compressor**: This compressor is lightweight, easy to transport, and has a 2.6 SCFM air flow at 90 PSI, making it perfect for home workshop users. Its oil-free pump ensures maintenance-free use, and it's priced around $299.99.
2.  **DEWALT 225 PSI Vertical Air Compressor**: This compressor offers 5.0 SCFM air flow at 90 PSI and operates quietly at 78 dBA. Its vertical storage design and collapsible handle make it ideal for home workshops, and it's priced around $399.99.
3.  **Rolair VT25BIG Direct Drive Air Compressor**: This compressor delivers 6.5 CFM air flow at 90 PSI with a 2.5 HP motor and cast-iron cylinder. Its folding handle and flat-free tires enhance jobsite mobility, making it suitable for heavy-duty contractors. It's priced around $499.99.
4.  **Makita MAC5200 Big Bore Air Compressor**: This compressor features a 3.0 HP motor delivering 6.5 CFM air flow at 90 PSI. Its cast-iron pump and oil-lubricated cooling system make it durable and high-output, but it's priced around $699.99, which is slightly above your budget.
