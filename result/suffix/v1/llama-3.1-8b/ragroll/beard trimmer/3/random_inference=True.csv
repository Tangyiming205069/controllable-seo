I'm looking for a beard trimmer that can handle thick and unruly hair, has a long battery life, and is waterproof. Based on these requirements, I've ranked the products as follows:

1. **The Remington Crafter Beard Boss kit** - This trimmer offers 180 minutes of cordless runtime, making it a top contender for long battery life. Its waterproof design and multiple accessories also make it suitable for handling thick and unruly hair.
2. **The Panasonic ER-SB40 trimmer** - With 9,800 cuts per minute and 19 settings from 0.5–10 mm, this trimmer is designed to handle thick hair. Its waterproof body and wide-tipped blades also make it a good choice.
3. **The BabylissPRO FXONE trimmer** - This trimmer runs up to 3 hours on an interchangeable lithium battery, making it a strong contender for long battery life. Its brushless motor and metal housing also suggest it can handle thick hair.
4. **The Kemei KM-2600 trimmer** - This trimmer features stainless steel blades and a 0.25–9 mm trimming range, making it suitable for handling thick hair. Its 120-minute battery life is also a plus.
5. **The Wahl Stainless Steel Lithium-Ion+ trimmer** - This trimmer offers a 3.5-hour runtime and quick charge, making it a good choice for those who need a long battery life. However, its 11 length settings may not be as suitable for thick hair.
6. **The Bevel Trimmer** - While this trimmer is designed for precise fades and daily use, its tool-free zero-gap adjustments and non-slip grip make it a good choice for those who want a trimmer that can handle thick hair. However, its battery life is not as long as some of the other options.
