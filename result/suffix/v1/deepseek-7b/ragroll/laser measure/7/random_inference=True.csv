Assistant: ","

The Spectra LD58G and Makita LD080P are both laser distance meters designed for professional use in various construction and layout applications. Here are some key differences and similarities between the two tools:

1. Range: 

Spectra LD58G: The LD58G projects three 360° beams with a maximum range of up to 58 feet.

Makita LD080P: The LD080P measures up to 262 feet with ±1/16"" precision.

2. Accuracy:

Both tools are capable of providing accurate measurements. The LD58G has ±1/16"" accuracy, while the LD080P has ±1/16"" to 1/8"" accuracy depending on the distance.

3. Battery Life:

The LD58G has a battery life of up to 25 hours, while the LD080P has a battery life of up to 15 hours.

4. Auto Self-Leveling:

The LD58G has an auto self-leveling feature that allows it to level itself on uneven surfaces. The LD080P also has a leveling function but it requires manual adjustment.

5. Ceiling-Mount Accessories:

Both tools come with ceiling-mount accessories, making them suitable for interior layout work.

6. Functions:

The LD58G supports Pythagoras and volume calculations, while the LD080P also supports a range of other functions, such as area calculation, distance calculation, and angle measurement.

7. Memory:

The LD58G has a history memory of 20 measurements, while the LD080P has a memory of up to 1000 measurements.

8. Mount:

Both tools can be mounted on a tripod for added stability during measurements.

9. Protection:

The LD080P has an IP54 rating, which means it is protected against dust and low-pressure water jets. The LD58G is built tough for jobsite use, but it does not have an IP rating for water resistance.

10. Price:

The LD080P is generally more expensive than the LD58G",9
