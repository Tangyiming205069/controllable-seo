Based on your request, I've ranked the products according to their effectiveness, features, and user reviews. Here's the top 5 recommendations:

1. **The FOREO LUNA 3**: This product stands out for its 2-in-1 cleansing and firming solution, ultra-hygienic silicone, and customizable T-Sonic pulsations. It's clinically proven to remove 99.5% of impurities and enhance skincare absorption for all skin types.
2. **The Soniclear Elite by Michael Todd**: This product offers dermatologist-recommended, sonic-powered face and body cleansing with antimicrobial brush heads, improving fine lines, rough patches, and skin health across all skin types.

5. **The Beurer Facial Cleansing Brush**: This product offers deep cleansing up to 6x more effective than hand washing, with rotating brush heads suitable for sensitive skin types and thorough makeup removal, ideal for daily facial care.

I've excluded the other products from the list as they either have fewer features or are more expensive. The Vanity Planet Aira Facial Steamer is a great product, but it's not a cleansing brush, so I've removed it from the list. The Braun FaceSpa 851V is a 3-in-1 system, but it's more expensive and has a steeper learning curve, so I've ranked it lower. The Shiseido Cleansing Massage Brush is a great product, but it's more expensive and has fewer features than the top 5 products on this list. The sudo product is not a well-known brand, and I couldn't find any information about it, so I've excluded it from the list.

I've excluded the Vanity Planet Aira Facial Steamer and the Braun FaceSpa 851V as they are not traditional skin cleansing brushes, but rather facial steamers and epilators, respectively. The Shiseido Cleansing Massage Brush is a great product, but it's more of a massaging brush than a traditional cleansing brush, which is why it's not ranked higher. The FOREO LUNA 3 and The Soniclear Elite by Michael Todd are the top recommendations due to their advanced features and clinical proven effectiveness. The Liberex Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush and The Mary Kay Skinvigorate Sonic Skin Care System are also excellent options, offering deep cleansing and sonic technology. The Beurer Facial Cleansing Brush is a great option for those with sensitive skin. [/INST] <<SYS>>[INST] <<SYS>>
