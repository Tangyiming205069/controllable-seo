[/INST]","Based on the user's request for an eyeshadow and the features they are looking for, here are my top three recommendations ranked in order:

1. Pat McGrath Labs Mothership Eye Palettes: This product stands out due to its wide variety of 20 creamy, high-saturation shadows, offering bold and customizable artistry. The wet/dry application allows for versatility, catering to both editorial and luxe looks.

2. NARS’ limited-edition Orgasm eyeshadow palette: This palette includes 9 sultry shades with satin, shimmer, and matte finishes, delivering high-impact color in one stroke, which seems to meet the user's preference for vibrant payoff.

3. ColourPop’s Sweet Talk palette: While the focus may be more on peach and coral tones, this palette still offers a variety of finishes (matte, metallic, pressed glitter, and Super Shock) that cater to diverse eye looks. Its easy application and vibrant payoff make it a suitable choice.

Honorable Mention: Milani Gilded Eyeshadow Sticks (vegan and cruelty-free) and L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Monos (long-lasting, comfortable wear) may appeal to users who have specific ethical and durability preferences.

Tarte’s tarteist™ PRO travel palette is also a good selection, but the limited number of shades (6) might be less appealing to users preferring more color versatility. NYX Ultimate Shadow Palettes are recommended for those who enjoy a wide range of color combos but should be cautious of issues related to fallout and may not be the best choice for beginners. Too Faced’s chocolate-infused eyeshadow palette offers a delightful scent and a variety of finishes but may have more of a focus on natural looks, which the user did not explicitly request.",9
