The CHUWI HiPad X Magnetic Keyboard offers an affordable and portable typing solution for HiPad X tablets, featuring magnetic docking for seamless attachment, priced at $29.90.  [/INST]","Based on your request for a tablet, here are my top 3 recommendations:

1. LG G Pad IV 8.0 FHD - This tablet offers both entertainment and everyday productivity with its 8-inch Full HD display, expandable storage, dual cameras, Comfort View mode, and pre-installed Microsoft Office.

2. Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE - This tablet is perfect for work, play, and seamless device connectivity with its 12.4"" display, Dolby Atmos speakers, 5G connectivity, redesigned S Pen, and long-lasting battery.

3. Google Pixel Tablet - This tablet is designed to provide seamless smart home control, entertainment, and productivity features, and is a great choice for those who are deep in the Google ecosystem.

If you are looking for a more affordable typing solution, I would also recommend the CHUWI HiPad X Magnetic Keyboard for any compatible tablet.

The Acer Iconia Tab P10 and the Huawei MatePad Pro are also solid options, but I've ranked them lower due to their larger screen size and price. The Apple iPad mini (6th Gen) is a great choice for compact, high-performance tablet users, but it is pricier and not included in the initial list. The Alcatel 3T10 (2020) is suitable for family entertainment and safe children's use, but it does not offer the same level of productivity features as the other options.",1
