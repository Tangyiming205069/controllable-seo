这是一个常见的JavaScript问题，下面是一个使用正则表达式解决的示例：

```javascript
function findEmail(str) {
  var emailPattern = /^[\w-]+(\.[\w-]+)*@([\w-]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7}$/;
  return emailPattern.test(str);
}

console.log(findEmail('test@example.com')); // 输出：true
console.log(findEmail('test@.com')); // 输出：false
console.log(findEmail('test_example.com')); // 输出：false
console.log(findEmail('test@.co.uk')); // 输出：true
console.log(findEmail('test')); // 输出：false
```

这个函数`findEmail`使用了正则表达式来验证输入的字符串是否是一个有效的电子邮件地址。正则表达式`/^[\w-]+(\.[\w-]+)*@([\w-]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7}$/`用于匹配符合电子邮件地址格式的字符串。

以下是正则表达式的各个部分的作用：

- `^`：匹配字符串的开始
- `[\w-]+`：匹配一个或多个单词字符或连字符
- `(\.[\w-]+)*`：匹配零个或多个`.`后面跟着一个或多个单词字符或连字符
- `@`：匹配字符`@`
- `([\w-]+)`：匹配一个或多个单词字符或连字符
- `\.`：匹配字符`.`
- `+`：匹配一个或多个字符
- `[a-zA-Z]{2,7}`：匹配2到7个字母字符
- `$`：匹配字符串的结束

这个正则表达式匹配符合以下格式的字符串：

- 至少有一个或多个单词字符或连字符，后面跟着零个或多个`.`，然后是至少两个或七个字母字符，最后是`@`，至少一个或多个单词字符或连字符，一个`.`，和至少两个或七个字母字符。
