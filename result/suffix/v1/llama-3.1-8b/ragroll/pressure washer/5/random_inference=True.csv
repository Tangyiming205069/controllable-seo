To provide a ranked list of product recommendations based on your request, I'll use a combination of natural language processing and product analysis. Here's a step-by-step approach to generate the list:

1.  **Identify Key Features**: Extract the key features and specifications from each product description to create a standardized comparison list.
2.  **Prioritize User Preferences**: Determine the most important factors for your user, such as power (PSI), flow rate (GPM), mobility, durability, and price.
3.  **Rank Products**: Assign weights to each product based on how well they meet the user's preferences and calculate a score for each product.
4.  **Generate the Ranked List**: Arrange the products in order of their scores to provide the user with the top recommendations.

Here's the comparison list with the extracted features and specifications:

| Product | PSI | GPM | Mobility | Durability | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MTM Hydro PF22 | 5000 | 5.3 | 4/5 | 5/5 | High |
| DEWALT DWPW2400 | 2400 | 1.1 | 4/5 | 5/5 | Medium |
| Stanley FATMAX | 2900 | 2.0 | 5/5 | 5/5 | High |
| Westinghouse WPX2700 | 2700 | 2.3 | 4/5 | 5/5 | Medium |
| Kärcher K5 Premium | 2000 | 1.4 | 4/5 | 5/5 | Medium |
| Generac 2900 PSI | 2900 | 2.0 | 5/5 | 5/5 | High |

| Stihl RE 90 | 120 | 2.5 | 4/5 | 4/5 | Low |

Prioritizing user preferences, I'll assign weights to each feature:

*   Power (PSI): 30%
*   Flow rate (GPM): 20%
*   Mobility: 20%
*   Durability: 15%
