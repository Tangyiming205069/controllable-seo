I'd like to know which portable air conditioner would be best for my small apartment (around 400 sq. ft.). My budget is around $200-$300, and I'm looking for something that's energy efficient and quiet. I also want a unit that's easy to move around and has a dehumidifier mode.

Based on your analysis, please rank the products from 1 to 5, with 1 being the best recommendation.
