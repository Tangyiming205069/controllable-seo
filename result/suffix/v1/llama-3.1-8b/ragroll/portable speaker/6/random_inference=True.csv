Based on your request for a portable speaker that's suitable for a party and can last a day long, I've ranked the following products according to their features and performance:

1.  **JBL Flip 6**: This speaker is a great choice for a party due to its powerful two-way sound, 12-hour playtime, and IP67 water and dust protection. Its racetrack woofer, separate tweeter, and dual passive radiators ensure clear and robust sound, making it perfect for a day-long party.
2.  **Bose SoundLink Revolve II**: With its immersive 360° sound, up to 13 hours of playtime, and voice assistant access, this speaker is ideal for everyday carry and deep-listening experiences. Its water-resistant and impact-resistant design also makes it suitable for outdoor use.
3.  **Ultimate Ears BOOM 3**: This speaker delivers balanced 360° audio with deep bass and 15-hour battery life, making it a great option for a party. Its rugged, waterproof IP67 build and durable performance fabric ensure it can withstand outdoor use.

5.  **Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 7**: This speaker blends immersive stereo sound with elegant design, but its 8-hour battery life may not be sufficient for a day-long party. It's still a great option for audiophiles seeking refined acoustics and stylish portability, but it may not be the best choice for a party.
6.  **The Marshall Emberton II**: While this speaker offers over 30 hours of playtime and rich sound in a rugged design, its compact size may limit its sound quality and volume compared to the other options.
7.  **The soundcore 3**: This speaker features dual titanium drivers for high-fidelity treble and enhanced BassUp tech, but its 24-hour playtime may not be fully utilized in a party setting, and its IPX7 waterproofing may not be as robust as some of the other options.
