[/INST]","Based on your request for a sleeping bag for warm weather, here are the ranked product recommendations:

1. Sea to Summit Ascent Down Sleeping Bag - This sleeping bag offers RDS-certified 750+ Ultra-Dry Down insulation, Free-Flow Zip for ventilation, and a relaxed mummy fit, making it a versatile and weather-resistant three-season choice. It's a good balance between warmth and breathability, which is ideal for warm weather use.

2. Snugpak Basecamp Navigator sleeping bag - With its Isofibre® filling, a soft touch, and versatile design that unzips into a quilt, this sleeping bag offers a comfort range down to 28°F. While it's rated for cooler temperatures, the versatile design makes it suitable for warm weather as well.

3. Marmot Sawtooth Sleeping Bag - This sleeping bag uses 650-fill Down Defender insulation with dual-side zippers and an expandable footbox, offering a 15°F rating. It's slightly warmer than the previous two options, but the dual-side zippers and expandable footbox provide good ventilation for warm weather use.

The Western Mountaineering AlpinLite - Despite its 20°F rating, the Western Mountaineering AlpinLite's ultralight design and wide mummy shape could still be suitable for warm weather, especially for lighter loads and less demanding conditions. However, it's ranked lower due to its lower temperature rating compared to the other warm weather options.

5. NEMO Jazz sleeping bag - While the NEMO Jazz sleeping bag offers bed-like comfort outdoors, its built-in sheet, integrated pad sleeve, and Blanket Fold™ draft collar make it a more luxurious choice. The insulation may be too heavy for warm weather camping.

6. Mountain Hardwear Phantom sleeping bag and The Valandré SWING CO 850 - Both of these sleeping bags are designed for cold-season use, with the Mountain Hardwear Phantom being rated for 0°F and The Valandré SWING CO 850 featuring high-tech tubular construction for exceptional warmth in cold, rugged conditions.
