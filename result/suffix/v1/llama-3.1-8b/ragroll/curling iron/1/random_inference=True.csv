I'm looking for a curling iron that can create long-lasting curls with minimal frizz and a variety of curl types. I have medium-length hair. Based on my preferences, I recommend the following products:

1.  **The T3 SinglePass Curl 1.25""**: This curling iron features a CeraGloss ceramic barrel and smart microchip with 5 heat settings for glossy, long-lasting curls. It's designed for all hair lengths, making it ideal for medium-length hair. The digital precision and smooth glide ensure that curls are created with minimal frizz.
