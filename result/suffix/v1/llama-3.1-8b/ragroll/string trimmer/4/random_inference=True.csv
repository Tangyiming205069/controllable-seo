To assist you in selecting the best string trimmer for your needs, I've compiled a ranked list of recommendations based on your preferences and yard size. Here's the list:

1.  **Husqvarna 122C Gas String Trimmer**: This is a top recommendation for you due to its ease of use, low noise, and Smart Start technology, making it perfect for homeowners with medium-sized yards. Its 22cc engine provides sufficient power for trimming and edging.
2.  **BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX String Trimmer/Edger**: This is a great option for you, offering a compact, cordless design with a brushless motor and automatic feed spool. Its adjustable height and quick conversion between trimming and edging make it ideal for medium-sized yards.
3.  **CRAFTSMAN V20 String Trimmer**: This is another excellent choice for you, featuring a brushless motor, adjustable swath, and WeatherGuard technology. Its up to 75 minutes runtime makes it suitable for medium-sized yards.
4.  **The DeWalt 20V MAX Cordless String Trimmer**: Although it's a great product, its 13"" cutting swath might not be enough for larger yards. However, its variable speed trigger and gear drive transmission make it a powerful option for smaller to medium-sized yards.
5.  **The Makita 36V (18V X2) LXT Brushless String Trimmer**: While it's a high-end product, its 36V power might be overkill for your yard size. However, its direct-drive performance and Star Protection tech make it a great option for larger yards or heavy-duty trimming.

I've excluded the following products from the list:

*   The RedMax TRZ230S Trimmer, as it's more geared towards professional landscapers and large yards.
*   The Toro 60V Flex-Force String Trimmer, as its high price point and 45 minutes runtime might not be worth it for your needs.
*   The Honda HHT35SLTA Trimmer, as its high price point and 35cc engine might be overkill for your yard size.
