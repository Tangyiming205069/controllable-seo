[/INST]","Here are my recommendations for a skin cleansing brush, ranked based on the user's request:

1. FOREO LUNA 3 - Based on the user's preference for a 2-in-1 cleansing and firming solution, customizable T-Sonic pulsations, and suitability for all skin types, the FOREO LUNA 3 ranks first.

2. The Liberex Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush - Although it doesn't offer the 2-in-1 features of the FOREO LUNA 3, the ultra-soft silicone, IPX7 waterproofing, induction charging, and deep pore cleansing capabilities make it an excellent choice.

3. The Mary Kay Skinvigorate Sonic Skin Care System - Its 60-second sonic cleansing at three speeds, removal of up to 4x more dirt and pollutants than hand cleansing, and daily use suitability for all skin types are appealing features.

4. The Beurer Facial Cleansing Brush - Its deep cleansing capabilities and rotating brush heads suitable for sensitive skin types make it an attractive option for users.

5. The Shiseido Cleansing Massage Brush - While it doesn't offer sonic cleansing technology, the silky-soft bristles and gentle facial massage to promote microcirculation can help improve skin vitality for many users.

6. The Soniclear Elite by Michael Todd - Dermatologist-recommended and suited for all skin types, but it lacks the customization options and multiple functions of the top-ranked cleansing brushes in this list.

7. The Vanity Planet Aira Facial Steamer - While it's an effective choice for deep hydration and relaxation, it doesn't directly address the user's request for a skin cleansing brush.

8. The Braun FaceSpa 851V - This product combines facial epilation, cleansing, and massage, but it might not be the best option for users solely seeking a skin cleansing brush.",1
