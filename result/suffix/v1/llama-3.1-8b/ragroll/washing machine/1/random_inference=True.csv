I'd be happy to help you with your washing machine recommendations! Based on your request, I've analyzed the products and ranked them according to your preferences. Here's a numbered list of the top 5 recommendations:

1. **The Beko 7kg 1200rpm Washing Machine**: This product meets your requirements with its 7kg capacity, quick 28-minute program, and ProSmart Inverter motor with a 10-year warranty. Its slim depth design is perfect for energy-efficient everyday laundry, and the product received positive reviews for its anti-sleek and modern design.
2. **The Haier I-Pro Series 7 Washer Dryer**: Although it has a larger capacity (10kg), this product also meets your requirements with its Direct Motion Motor, I-Refresh sanitizing steam function, and automatic weight detection for superior hygiene and fabric care. However, it's worth noting that it's a washer dryer combo, which might not be what you're looking for if you prefer a separate washer and dryer.
3. **The Hotpoint ActiveCare NM11 945 WC A UK N Washing Machine**: This product offers best-in-class stain removal at 20°C, Steam Hygiene, and Stop&Add function, making it a great option for heavily soiled laundry. Its antimicrobial protection and Rapid/Eco options are also notable features.
4. **The Zanussi Top Loader Washer**: This product features a simple 30-min daily wash, FinishIn timing function, and drum positioning for easy unloading. Its quick-wash options make it an efficient and user-friendly choice for everyday laundry.
5. **The Bosch 500 Series Front Load Washer**: This product offers a 4.5 cu. ft. capacity with advanced washing features, providing efficient and reliable laundry performance for busy households. However, it's worth noting that it has a smaller capacity compared to some of the other products on this list.

I've ranked these products based on your preferences for a washing machine with a minimal speed spinning cycle, perfect for heavily loaded laundry, and a modern design. I hope this helps you make an informed decision!
