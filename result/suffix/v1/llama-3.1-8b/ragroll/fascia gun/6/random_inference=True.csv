I'd be happy to help you find the perfect fascia gun based on your preferences. However, I noticed that some of the products listed are not actually fascia guns, but rather massage guns or other types of therapy devices. I'll provide you with a ranked list of the products that are specifically designed for fascia work.

Here's the ranked list:

1. **Echo3 Active**: This product is specifically designed for fascia work, with features such as speed control and a focus on muscle soreness relief. It's a high-powered device that promotes blood flow and long-term muscle recovery.
2. **The Opove M3 Pro**: While not exclusively a fascia gun, this product delivers 12mm amplitude and up to 70lbs of stall force, making it suitable for deep-tissue fascia work. Its quiet operation and 5 speed settings make it ideal for athletes needing powerful, long-lasting muscle recovery.
3. **The Therabody Theragun Prime**: While primarily a massage gun, the Theragun Prime can be used for fascia work, especially with its 16mm amplitude and 5 speed settings. Its ergonomic design and powerful motor make it suitable for full-body recovery and pain relief.

I've excluded the other products on the list as they are either not specifically designed for fascia work or are more geared towards general massage or therapy. If you have any specific preferences or requirements, feel free to let me know and I can provide a more tailored recommendation!

I'm glad you're looking for a fascia gun! However, I noticed that none of the products you listed are specifically designed as fascia guns. Fascia guns are typically used for myofascial release and are designed to target the fascia, a layer of connective tissue surrounding muscles.

That being said, I can recommend some products that are similar to fascia guns and may be suitable for your needs. Here's a revised list:

1. **The R3 Active Massage Gun**: While not specifically designed as a fascia gun, the R3 Active Massage Gun has a 5-speed setting and 5 head attachments, making it a versatile tool for targeting different areas of the body, including the fascia.
2. **The Therabody Theragun Prime**: This product offers 16mm amplitude deep-tissue massage, which can be beneficial for targeting the fascia. Its ergonomic design and Bluetooth app guidance also make it a great option for those seeking a more guided experience.
3. **The Opove M3 Pro**: This product delivers 12mm amplitude and up to 70lbs of stall force, making it suitable for deep-tissue massage and potentially effective for targeting the fascia.
4. **The Medcursor Handheld Massage Gun**: This product features a quiet brushless motor and 5 speeds, making it a great option for those seeking a compact and easy-to-use tool for deep tissue relief, including fascial release.
5. **The Yunmai SlimChic massage gun**: This product delivers up to 3200 RPM and has three speed modes, making it a good option for those seeking a compact and convenient tool for muscle relief, including fascial release.

Please note that while these products may be suitable for targeting the fascia, they may not be specifically designed as fascia guns. If you're looking for a product specifically designed for myofascial release, I recommend researching further to find a product that meets your needs.

Ranking these products based on your request, I would recommend the following order:

1. **The R3 Active Massage Gun**
2. **The Therabody Theragun Prime**
3. **The Opove M3 Pro**
4. **The Medcursor Handheld Massage Gun**
5. **The Yunmai SlimChic massage gun**
