I see you're interested in a portable speaker that's rugged, waterproof, and perfect for outdoor use, especially near water or in a beach setting. Based on your preferences, I highly recommend the following top 3 options:

1. **Ultimate Ears BOOM 3**: This speaker is specifically designed for outdoor enthusiasts, with a rugged, waterproof IP67 build that can withstand exposure to water, dust, and even being submerged in water. Its balanced 360° audio and deep bass make it perfect for music lovers who want to enjoy their favorite tunes near water or in a beach setting.
2. **Tribit StormBox Micro 2**: This pocket-sized speaker is another great option for outdoor use, with IP67 water and dust resistance and a 120-ft Bluetooth 5.3 range. It also doubles as a power bank, making it a great value for travelers and outdoor enthusiasts.
3. **The JBL Flip 6**: While not as rugged as the first two options, the JBL Flip 6 is still a great choice for outdoor use, with IP67 water and dust protection and 12-hour playtime. Its two-way sound and dual passive radiators make it a great option for parties and travel.

All three of these options are great choices for outdoor use, but if you're looking for the most rugged and waterproof option, the Ultimate Ears BOOM 3 is the way to go. If you're looking for a more affordable option with additional features like a power bank, the Tribit StormBox Micro 2 is a great choice. If you want a more traditional speaker with great sound quality, the JBL Flip 6 is a great option.
