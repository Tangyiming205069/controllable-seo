I'm looking for a barbecue grill that can handle large groups of people. Which one would you recommend?

Here are my preferences:

* Large cooking space (at least 700 sq. in.)
* Digital or Wi-Fi connectivity for easy temperature control
* Ability to smoke or wood-fire grill
* Durable and long-lasting construction

Based on your analysis, I would recommend the following top 3 products:

1.  **The Pit Boss Classic Pellet Grill**: This grill offers 700 sq. in. of cooking space, digital temperature control, and the ability to smoke or wood-fire grill. It's also made with durable porcelain-coated steel, making it a great choice for large groups.
2.  **The Traeger Pro 780**: This grill has 780 sq. in. of cooking space, WiFIRE app control, and TurboTemp tech for fast, consistent cooking. It's also designed for smoking, roasting, or baking, making it a great choice for large groups.
3.  **The Broil King Baron S 490 PRO IR**: This grill features 460 sq. in. of cooking space, 4 stainless burners, and an infrared side burner. While it doesn't have as much cooking space as the top two recommendations, it's a great choice for those who want premium versatility and durability.
