I am looking for a coffee maker that can make both single-serve and full carafe brewing. I also want to have options like programming, travel mug compatibility, and up to 14 oz. brew size. What are my top 3 recommendations?

Here are my top 3 recommendations:

1. **Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Coffee Maker**: This coffee maker offers single-serve or full carafe brewing using K-Cup pods or ground coffee. It features options like programming, travel mug compatibility, and up to 14 oz. brew size. Its flexible design makes it ideal for users who want to switch between single-serve and full carafe brewing.
2. **The Breville Barista Express**: Although it's a bit more expensive, the Breville Barista Express is a versatile coffee maker that can grind, dose, and extract coffee. It offers 16 grind settings, PID temperature control, and manual microfoam milk texturing. However, it's worth noting that it's more geared towards coffee enthusiasts who want to master third-wave coffee at home.
3. **The DeLonghi Dinamica LatteCrema**: This fully automatic espresso machine can make a variety of coffee drinks, including lattes and cappuccinos. It features 18 drink recipes, a conical grinder, and a self-cleaning milk frother. While it's more expensive than the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, it offers more advanced features and a wider range of coffee options.

These three coffee makers meet your requirements and offer a range of features to suit your needs. However, if you're looking for a more affordable option with a simpler design, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew may be the best choice. If you're willing to invest in a more advanced coffee maker with a wider range of features, the DeLonghi Dinamica LatteCrema may be the way to go. The Breville Barista Express falls somewhere in between, offering a balance of features and price.

I am looking for a coffee maker that can make a large quantity of coffee. I want something that can make at least 12 cups of coffee at a time. I also want the full carafe brewing option.

2. **Breville Barista Express**: This machine can make up to 12 cups of coffee at a time and has a full carafe brewing option. It also has a built-in grinder and manual microfoam milk texturing, making it a great choice for those who want to create high-quality coffee drinks at home.

Based on your request, I've ranked the products according to your needs. Here's a numbered list of the top 5 recommendations:

1. **The Gaggia Cadorna Prestige**: As you mentioned, this super-automatic espresso machine has automatic top 1 product espresso with 3 shots, making it perfect for your needs. Its ease of use and customization options make it a top choice.
2. **The Breville Barista Express**: This machine offers a range of grind settings and manual microfoam milk texturing, making it ideal for those who want to master third-wave coffee at home.
3. **The DeLonghi Dinamica LatteCrema**: This fully automatic espresso machine features 18 drink recipes, a conical grinder, and a self-cleaning milk frother, making it perfect for espresso lovers wanting smart café quality at home.
