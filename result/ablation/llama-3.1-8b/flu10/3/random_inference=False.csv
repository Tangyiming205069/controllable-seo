I'd like to get a coffee machine that is easy to use, has a good capacity, and is priced reasonably. Here's my ranked list of recommendations:

1. **BrewMaster Classic**: With a 4.2-star rating and a price of $129, this coffee maker is a great balance of quality and affordability. Its 12-cup capacity makes it perfect for home use, and its durable design ensures it will last for a long time.
2. **Grind&Brew Plus**: This coffee machine has a 4.4-star rating and a price of $349. Its integrated grinder ensures freshly ground coffee every time, and its 10-cup capacity is suitable for most households.
3. **ColdBrew Master**: With a 4.3-star rating and a price of $199, this machine is perfect for cold brew lovers. Its 6-cup capacity is a good compromise between size and convenience.
4. **QuickBrew Express**: This coffee maker has a 4.0-star rating and a price of $89. Its compact design and 1-cup capacity make it ideal for busy individuals who need a quick cup of coffee.
5. **FrenchPress Classic**: With a 4.1-star rating and a price of $29, this traditional French press is a great option for those who want a rich and flavorful cup of coffee. Its 4-cup capacity is suitable for small households.

I've ranked these options based on your requirements, but keep in mind that the **SingleServe Wonder** is also a great option if you're looking for a compact and convenient coffee machine. However, its lower rating and smaller capacity make it less appealing than the other options. The **EspressoMaster 2000** and **Cappuccino King** are high-end machines that are not as affordable, but they offer advanced features and high-quality brewing technology. The **CafePro Elite** is a professional-grade machine that is out of your budget, but it's a great option if you're looking for a high-end coffee machine for your business or large household. The **LatteArt Pro** is another high-end machine that is not as affordable, but it's perfect for those who want to create perfect lattes and cappuccinos. <<SYS>>[INST] <<SYS>>
