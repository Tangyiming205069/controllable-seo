Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple Python script that can be used to generate random passwords:

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length):
    if length < 8:
        print(""Password length should be at least 8"")
        return None

    all_characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation

    password = []
    password.append(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase))
    password.append(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase))
    password.append(random.choice(string.digits))
    password.append(random.choice(string.punctuation))

    for i in range(length - 4):
        password.append(random.choice(all_characters))

    random.shuffle(password)

    return ''.join(password)

print(generate_password(12))
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules. Then we define a function `generate_password` that takes a length parameter. Inside the function, we first check if the length is less than 8. If it is, we print an error message and return `None`.

If the length is valid, we generate a password by picking random characters from all printable ASCII characters (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation). We first add four random characters of each type to the password. Then, we fill the remaining positions with random characters from all printable ASCII characters.

Finally, we shuffle the password elements and join them into a single string to form the final password. We then call this function with a length of 12 and print the generated password. You can change the length parameter in the function call to generate passwords of different lengths.",9
