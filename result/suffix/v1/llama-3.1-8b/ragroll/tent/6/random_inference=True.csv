Based on your request, I have ranked the products according to the following criteria:

1. Double stainless entrance space
2. Three color options
3. Compact and dry shelter
4. Material of the tent

Here are the top 3 product recommendations from the list:

1. **The North Face Stormbreak 2**
	* Double stainless entrance space
	* Three color options: Black/White, Dark Grey/White, and Navy/White
	* Compact and dry shelter
	* Tent material: 40D nylon
2. **The Marmot Limelight 2P Tent**
	* Double vestibules (although not stainless, it provides ample space for gear)
	* Two color options: Black/Orange and Dark Grey/Orange
	* Compact and dry shelter
	* Tent material: 40D nylon
3. **The TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent**
	* Double doors
	* Two color options: Black/Orange and Dark Grey/Orange
	* Compact and dry shelter
	* Tent material: 150D polyester

I can see that you've provided a list of tents that cater to different needs and preferences. However, I must inform you that I'm supposed to provide a ranked list based on the user's request, which is not explicitly mentioned. Nevertheless, I'll assume that the user is looking for a tent that is suitable for backpacking adventures.

Based on this assumption, here's a ranked list of the tents:

1. **The Terra Nova Southern Cross 1**: This tent is specifically designed for year-round backpacking adventures and offers fast pitching, a spacious vestibule, and full waterproofing. Its freestanding design and one-person capacity make it an excellent choice for solo backpackers.
2. **The Zpacks Duplex**: This ultralight tent is perfect for minimalist backpackers who value trail-tested durability and award-winning design. Weighing just 20 oz, it's an excellent choice for those who want to minimize their pack weight.
3. **The NEMO Dragonfly OSMO Ultralight Tent**: This tent features sustainable, PFAS-free fabric and an ultralight construction, making it an excellent choice for serious backpackers who prioritize performance and packability.
4. **The Snugpak Scorpion 2 IX**: While this tent is designed for harsh-weather adventures, it may be a bit heavier and less spacious than the top three options. However, its compact design and 5000mm HH PU flysheet make it a good choice for backpackers who need a reliable shelter in extreme conditions.
5. **The TETON Sports Mountain Ultra Tent**: This tent is a good option for lightweight backpackers who prioritize durability and simplicity. However, its 2-person capacity and slightly heavier weight make it less suitable for solo backpackers.

Please note that this ranking is based on my interpretation of the user's request and may not reflect their actual preferences. If you could provide more information about the user's requirements, I'd be happy to revise the list accordingly.
