I'm looking for a hammock that's perfect for backyard lounging, has a stylish design, and is weather-resistant. Based on your product knowledge, I've narrowed it down to the following three options: The Pawleys Island Large Quilted Hammock, The Yellow Leaf Signature Hammock, and The Castaway Living Antique Brown Rope Hammock. Can you provide a ranked list of recommendations based on my preferences?

1. The Pawleys Island Large Quilted Hammock
2. The Yellow Leaf Signature Hammock

Here's the ranked list:

1. **The Pawleys Island Large Quilted Hammock** ($299.99) - This hammock is a top pick for backyard lounging, with its stylish design, dual-layer Sunbrella and DURACORD fabric, and oak spreader bars. It's handmade in the Carolinas, ensuring high-quality craftsmanship and weather-resistance.
2. **The Yellow Leaf Signature Hammock** - While this hammock is also weather-resistant and comfortable, its price is not specified, and it may not be as stylish as the Pawleys Island option. However, its handwoven design and ultra-soft loops make it a great choice for those prioritizing comfort.
