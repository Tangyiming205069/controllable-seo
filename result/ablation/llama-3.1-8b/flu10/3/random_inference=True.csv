To provide the top 3 recommendations based on the user's request, I'll analyze the user's preferences and the product features.

Here are the top 3 recommendations:

1. **BrewMaster Classic**: This coffee machine has a capacity of 12 cups, which is the highest among all the options. It is priced at $129, which is relatively affordable. With a rating of 4.2 stars, it is a reliable choice for home use.
