[/INST]"," [INST] <<USR>> I am looking for a wet-dry vacuum for a small workshop or garage. I need something that can handle both wet and dry messes, has a decent suction power, and is relatively easy to maneuver. I also have limited space, so a compact design is a must. I would prefer a cordless option, but a corded one is also acceptable if it's lightweight and easy to move around. I am not looking for anything too expensive, so a budget-friendly option would be ideal. Based on your analysis, which products would you recommend? [/INST] [INST] <<SYS>> Based on your requirements, I've analyzed the products and ranked them according to their features and benefits. Here's the list of recommendations:

1.  **The Makita 18V LXT Cordless Wet/Dry Vacuum**:
	* Compact and lightweight design (only 9.9 lbs)
	* Brushless motor for efficient suction (57 CFM)
	* HEPA filter for capturing 99.97% of dust and debris
	* 60 minutes runtime on a single charge
	* Affordable price point (around $200)
2.  **The Shop-Vac 6-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum**:
	* Portable and lightweight design (only 17.5 lbs)
	* 3.5 Peak HP motor for decent suction power

	* Fast filter changes for reduced downtime
	* Extra-large drain for easy water disposal
	* Decent suction power (4.25 Peak HP motor)
	* Reasonable price point (around $250)

I recommend the Makita 18V LXT Cordless Wet/Dry Vacuum as the top choice due to its compact design, efficient suction power, and affordable price point. However, if you prefer a corded option, the Shop-Vac 6-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum is a close second, offering a portable design, decent suction power, and reusable filters. The Craftsman 9-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac is also a good option, but it's slightly heavier and more expensive than the other two. [/INST] [INST] <<USR>> That",9
