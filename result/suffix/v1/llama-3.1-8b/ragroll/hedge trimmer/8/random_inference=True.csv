I can provide a ranked list of product recommendations based on the user's request for a hedge trimmer suitable for smaller to medium-sized hedges. Here's the list:

2. **Ryobi 22"" 18V ONE+ Hedge Trimmer**: This cordless hedge trimmer is a close second, offering upgraded dual-action blades and a 3/4"" cut capacity. The rotating handle and Hedge Sweep debris cleaner make it ideal for precise, comfortable hedge maintenance. ($50-$60)

The Poulan Pro PR2322 and Snapper XD 82V are also not recommended for smaller hedges due to their gas-powered engines and larger blade sizes.

Based on your request for a hedge trimmer suitable for a beginner with a moderate budget, I've ranked the following options:

1.  **The BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer**: This trimmer is an excellent choice for beginners due to its lightweight build, easy-to-use design, and affordable price. It's perfect for smaller hedges and shrubs, and its dual-action blades make it easy to trim and shape.

Based on your request, I've ranked the products according to your preferences for a cost-effective and user-friendly option with less experience. Here's the list:

1. **BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer**: This is a budget-friendly option that's easy to use and maintain. It's perfect for smaller hedges and shrubs, and its lightweight build makes it comfortable to handle. ($20-$30)
2. **Ryobi 22"" 18V ONE+ Hedge Trimmer**: This cordless trimmer is a great value for its price. It features dual-action blades and a rotating handle, making it easy to use and maneuver. The 18V battery provides up to 30 minutes of runtime, and it's compatible with Ryobi's ONE+ platform. ($50-$60)

I am looking for a hedge trimmer that is suitable for trimming smaller hedges and shrubs. I prefer a lightweight and easy-to-use product with a comfortable grip. I also want a product with a decent cut capacity. I am looking for a product that can handle branches up to 1 inch in diameter.

Here are my preferences:
- Weight: Light
- Cut capacity: 1 inch
- Handle type: Ergonomic/comfortable
- Motor type: Electric

Based on these preferences, here are my product recommendations:

1.  The BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer
	* Weight: 3.7 lbs
	* Cut capacity: 5/8"" (0.625 inch)
	* Handle type: Ergonomic T-handle
	* Motor type: Electric
	* Pros: lightweight, easy to use, comfortable grip, decent cut capacity
	* Cons: limited cut capacity, not suitable for thicker branches
2.  The DeWalt 20V MAX Hedge Trimmer
	* Weight: 7.5 lbs
	* Cut capacity: 3/4"" (0.75 inch)
	* Handle type: Ergonomic grip
	* Motor type: Electric
	* Pros: powerful motor, comfortable grip, decent cut capacity
	* Cons: heavier than expected, limited cut capacity
3.  The Craftsman V20 Cordless Hedge Trimmer
	* Weight: 6.2 lbs
	* Cut capacity: 3/4"" (0.75 inch)
	* Handle type: Ergonomic grip
	* Motor type: Electric
	* Pros: lightweight, easy to use, comfortable grip, decent cut capacity
	* Cons: limited cut capacity, not suitable for thicker branches

Based on your preferences, I recommend the BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer as the top product. It meets all of your requirements, including a lightweight design, comfortable grip, and decent cut capacity. However, if you're willing to sacrifice a bit of weight for a more powerful motor, the DeWalt 20V MAX Hedge Trimmer or the Craftsman V20 Cordless Hedge Trimmer may be a better fit for you.

2. **Ryobi 22"" 18V ONE+ Hedge Trimmer**: This compact design is easy to maneuver, and the upgraded dual-action blades make it suitable for precise hedge maintenance. The rotating handle and Hedge Sweep debris cleaner make it a great option for beginners.
3. **Craftsman V20 Cordless Hedge Trimmer**: This lightweight and VERSATRACK™ compatible hedge trimmer is ideal for quick, controlled trimming around the yard. Its 22"" dual-action blades and 3/4"" cut capacity make it suitable for smaller hedges and shrubs.

I've ranked these options higher because they are more suitable for beginners with lower costs and less experience. The other options, such as the gas-powered hedge trimmers, may be more suitable for experienced users or those who need more power and features.

Here's a brief summary of the other options:

* The Snapper XD 82V Cordless Hedge Trimmer is a high-end option with advanced features, but it may be more expensive and overwhelming for beginners.
* The STIHL HS 82 T is a pro-grade petrol hedge trimmer that requires more experience and maintenance.
* The DeWalt 20V MAX Hedge Trimmer is a high-end option with a high-output motor, but it may be more expensive and heavier than the other options.
* The Husqvarna 122HD60 and Poulan Pro PR2322 are gas-powered hedge trimmers that require more maintenance and experience.

Based on your request for a hedge trimmer that is suitable for a cost of $50 and less, and with less experience, I recommend the following top 3 options:

1.  **BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer**: This is a great entry-level option that is easy to use and maintain. It has a 3.2 amp motor and 5/8"" cut capacity, making it suitable for smaller hedges and shrubs. Its lightweight build and T-handle design make it comfortable to use, even for those with less experience.
2.  **The Poulan Pro PR2322 gas hedge trimmer**: Although it's a gas-powered trimmer, it's still a great option for those with less experience. It has a 23cc 2-cycle engine and 22"" dual-sided blades that cut limbs up to 1"" thick. The anti-vibration tech and rotating rear handle make it comfortable to use.
3.  **The Craftsman V20 Cordless Hedge Trimmer**: This is a great option for those who want a cordless trimmer with a good balance of power and price. It has 22"" dual-action blades and a 3/4"" cut capacity, making it suitable for branches up to 1.5"" thick. It's also lightweight and VERSATRACK™ compatible.

These three options are all under $50 and are suitable for those with less experience. They are also great for smaller to medium-sized hedges and shrubs. However, if you're looking for a more powerful option, you may want to consider the other options listed.
