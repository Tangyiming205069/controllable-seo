Assistant: ","

1. Power and Speed: The Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router is equipped with a POWERSTATE Brushless Motor that delivers a high speed of 31,000 RPM, making it suitable for various woodworking tasks. In comparison, the WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router offers a slower speed range of 8,000–23,000 RPM, making it suitable for intricate and versatile woodworking projects.
2. Corded vs Cordless: The Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router is a cordless tool that provides corded performance, similar to a 1.25 HP corded router. It offers the flexibility and mobility of a cordless tool, making it ideal for jobs that require you to move around a lot. The WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router is a corded tool, which provides consistent power and performance, but requires a power source to operate.
3. Motor Technology: The Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router is powered by a POWERSTATE Brushless Motor, which is designed for high performance and durability. The motor provides consistent power and torque, and is designed to last longer than traditional brushed motors. The WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router is powered by a standard motor, which may not provide the same level of performance and durability as the POWERSTATE Brushless Motor in the Milwaukee router.
4. Depth Adjustment: Both routers offer a dual LED lighting system that provides better visibility while working, but the Milwaukee router also features micro and macro depth adjustments, allowing for more precise control over the depth of the cut. The WEN router has macro and micro adjustments, but the Milwaukee router offers a wider range of depth adjustments, making it more versatile for different woodworking tasks.
5. Accessories and Hard Case: The Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router comes with a hard case and a variety of accessories, including a dust bag and a base. The WEN 15-Amp Variable Speed Plunge Router also comes with a hard case and a variety of accessories, such as a dust port and a wrench. Both routers are suitable for intricate and versatile woodworking, but the Milwaukee router offers more value with its additional accessories and hard case.

Overall, both routers are suitable for various woodworking tasks and offer different features and benefits. The Milwaukee M18 FUEL Compact Router offers a higher speed, more",9
