I'd like to get a wet-dry vacuum with a high peak horsepower rating, a large tank capacity, and a locking tank. Here are my top three preferences:

Based on these preferences, I've ranked the products as follows:

1. **The RIDGID 6.0 Peak HP NXT Wet/Dry Shop Vacuum** (6.5 peak HP, 5-gallon tank, locking tank)
2. **The Vacmaster Professional Beast Series 5-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac** (5.5 peak HP, 5-gallon tank, locking tank)
3. **The Craftsman 9-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac** (4.25 peak HP, 9-gallon tank, no locking tank)

The RIDGID 6.0 Peak HP NXT Wet/Dry Shop Vacuum takes the top spot due to its high peak horsepower rating and locking tank. The Vacmaster Professional Beast Series 5-Gallon Wet/Dry Vac comes in second, offering a high peak horsepower rating and a locking tank, although its tank capacity is slightly smaller than the top recommendation.
