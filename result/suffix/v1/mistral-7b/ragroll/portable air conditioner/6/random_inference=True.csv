2. SereneLife 8,000 BTU Portable AC: With cooling, fan, and dehumidifier modes, a remote control, and a window exhaust kit, this compact unit ensures efficient cooling for small homes while maintaining a quiet operation.

4. Toshiba 14,000 BTU (10,000 SACC) Portable AC: While this unit has powerful cooling capabilities, it might be slightly overkill for smaller spaces. But if energy efficiency and eco-conscious features are highly important, this model is a solid choice for rooms up to 550 sq. ft.
