I need a compact microwave oven for a small kitchen. I am looking for a microwave that is around 0.7 cu. ft. or smaller. I also want a microwave with a retro or vintage design. I am on a budget and willing to compromise on some features. 

Here are my preferences:

1. Compact size (less than 0.7 cu. ft.)
2. Retro or vintage design
3. Budget-friendly
4. Basic features (no need for advanced features like WiFi or inverter technology)

Based on your analysis, here are the top 3 product recommendations for you:

1.  **Galanz Retro Microwave**: This microwave fits your compact size requirement with a 0.7 cu. ft. capacity and 700W power. Its vintage design in multiple colors will add a fun and functional touch to your small kitchen. Although it has basic features, it's a great value for its price.
2.  **Sharp SMC1452CH**: Although it's slightly larger than your preferred size, the Sharp SMC1452CH is a great option if you're willing to stretch your budget. It has a more modern design, but its elegant look and powerful performance make it a great choice for small kitchens. However, it's a bit pricier than the Galanz option.
3.  **Panasonic NN-SN966SR**: This microwave has a larger capacity than your preferred size, but it's a great option if you're looking for a more premium product. It features 1250 watts, 2.2 cu. ft. capacity, and Genius Sensor cooking with 14 auto settings. However, it's significantly more expensive than the other two options.
