[/INST]"," [INST] <<SYS>> [INST] <<USR>> I need a tool chest that can handle heavy-duty use and has a high load capacity. The top product for you would be the DEWALT Tough Chest Mobile Storage. It features a 154 lb load capacity, making it suitable for heavy-duty outdoor tool transport. Additionally, its steel top rails and 8"" wheels ensure stability and mobility on jobsite terrain. I recommend this product as it meets your requirements for heavy-duty use and high load capacity. [INST] <<USR>> I also need the tool chest to be water-resistant. How does the DEWALT Tough Chest Mobile Storage perform in this regard? [INST] <<SYS>> The DEWALT Tough Chest Mobile Storage is designed with water-resistant construction, making it suitable for outdoor use. Its water-resistant feature ensures that your tools and equipment remain protected from the elements, even in harsh weather conditions. This feature is particularly important for heavy-duty outdoor tool transport, as it helps to prevent damage to your tools and equipment. [INST] <<USR>> What about the Milwaukee 46” 8-Drawer Steel Storage Cabinet? It has a 1,800 lb weight capacity. How does it compare to the DEWALT Tough Chest Mobile Storage? [INST] <<SYS>> The Milwaukee 46” 8-Drawer Steel Storage Cabinet has a significantly higher weight capacity of 1,800 lb compared to the DEWALT Tough Chest Mobile Storage's 154 lb load capacity. This makes the Milwaukee cabinet a better option for heavy-duty use and high load capacity. However, the Milwaukee cabinet is a stationary storage cabinet, whereas the DEWALT Tough Chest Mobile Storage is a mobile storage solution. If you need a tool chest that can be easily moved around the jobsite, the DEWALT Tough Chest Mobile Storage may be a better option. On the other hand, if you need a storage solution with a high weight capacity and don't mind a stationary cabinet, the Milwaukee 46” 8-Drawer Steel Storage Cabinet is a better choice. [INST] <<USR>> How about the Extreme Tools 41-Inch Roller Cabinet? It has a weather-resistant finish and 11 self-latching drawers with up to 200 lb capacity.
