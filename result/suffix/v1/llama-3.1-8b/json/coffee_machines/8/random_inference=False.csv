I understand that you're looking for a coffee machine with the following features:

1. Made of stainless steel
2. Easy to clean
3. Provides WiFi connectivity
4. Capacity of 1 cup
5. Ensures perfect temperature

Based on your preferences, I recommend the following top 3 products:

1. **SingleServe Wonder**: This compact and convenient single-serve coffee machine is made of stainless steel, easy to clean, and has WiFi connectivity. It's perfect for individuals on-the-go and ensures a perfect temperature for your coffee. ($59)
2. **EspressoMaster 2000**: Although not specifically mentioned, this compact and efficient espresso machine has advanced brewing technology, ensuring perfect temperature and is made of stainless steel. It's a bit pricier than the SingleServe Wonder, but still a great option. ($399)
3. **CafePro Elite**: While not the cheapest option, the CafePro Elite is a professional-grade coffee machine with multiple brewing options, a sleek design, and a stainless steel build. It's easy to clean and has WiFi connectivity, making it a great choice for those who want a high-end coffee machine. ($899)

Please note that the ColdBrew Master and FrenchPress Classic do not meet the WiFi connectivity requirement, and the Grind&Brew Plus and LatteArt Pro do not meet the 1-cup capacity requirement. The QuickBrew Express is a good option, but it doesn't meet the stainless steel requirement. The BrewMaster Classic is a durable and easy-to-use coffee maker, but it's not made of stainless steel and has a larger capacity than required. The Cappuccino King is a high-end machine, but it's not made of stainless steel and has a capacity of 2 cups.",7
