To provide the best recommendations, I'll need to consider the user's preferences and needs. Based on the provided information, I'll assume the user is looking for a hedge trimmer that is:

1. Effective in cutting thick branches
2. Easy to use and maneuver
3. Has a good balance between power and weight
4. Suitable for both vertical and horizontal trimming

Considering these factors, here's a ranked list of product recommendations:

1.  **The STIHL HS 82 T**: This pro-grade petrol hedge trimmer offers the highest cutting speed (up to 5,100 strokes/min) and is designed for precision vertical and horizontal trimming. Its ergonomic design and reduced vibration make it a top choice for users who need a high-performance trimmer.
2.  **The DeWalt 20V MAX Hedge Trimmer**: With its high-output motor and 22"" laser-cut blades, this trimmer can handle thick branches and provides a clean, fast trimming experience. Its lightweight design (7.5 lbs) and included 5.0Ah battery make it an excellent choice for users who prioritize ease of use.
3.  **The Ryobi 22"" 18V ONE+ Hedge Trimmer**: This compact trimmer features upgraded dual-action blades and a rotating handle, making it ideal for precise and comfortable hedge maintenance. Its Fast18V runtime+ battery and Hedge Sweep debris cleaner are additional benefits that make it a great value.
4.  **The Poulan Pro PR2322**: This gas hedge trimmer packs a 23cc 2-cycle engine and 22"" dual-sided blades, making it suitable for cutting thick branches. Its anti-vibration tech and rotating rear handle provide a comfortable trimming experience.

The following trimmers are not recommended based on the user's preferences:

* The BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer: This trimmer has a smaller cutting capacity (5/8"") and may not be as effective for thicker branches.

I will provide the recommendations based on the user's request. Since the user is looking for a hedge trimmer, I will rank the products according to their features, price, and user reviews.

Here are the top 3 recommendations:

1. **The DeWalt 20V MAX Hedge Trimmer**: This product stands out for its high-output motor, 22"" laser-cut blades, and 3/4"" cut capacity. It's also lightweight, weighing just 7.5 lbs, and comes with a 5.0Ah battery and charger. User reviews praise its ease of use and effectiveness in trimming hedges.
2. **The Ryobi 22"" 18V ONE+ Hedge Trimmer**: This product is a close second, offering a compact design, upgraded dual-action blades, and a 3/4"" cut capacity. The rotating handle and Hedge Sweep debris cleaner make it ideal for precise, comfortable hedge maintenance. User reviews appreciate its ease of use and versatility.
3. **The Snapper XD 82V Cordless Hedge Trimmer**: This product offers 800W brushless power, 26"" steel blades, and a rotating handle. The 2Ah/4Ah battery provides up to 90 minutes of reliable trimming performance. User reviews praise its power and reliability, but note that it's a bit heavier than the other two options.

The other products on the list are still good options, but they don't quite match the top 3 in terms of features, price, and user reviews. The Craftsman V20 Cordless Hedge Trimmer is a good option for those who want a lightweight and VERSATRACK™ compatible trimmer, but it's a bit pricier than the top 3. The BLACK+DECKER 17"" Electric Hedge Trimmer is a good option for smaller hedges and shrubs, but it's not as powerful as the top 3. The STIHL HS 82 T is a pro-grade petrol hedge trimmer, but it's also the priciest option on the list. The Poulan Pro PR2322 gas hedge trimmer and the Husqvarna 122HD60 gas hedge trimmer are both good options, but they're also gas-powered, which may not be as convenient as the cordless options.
