I have damaged hair and I'm looking for a shampoo that repairs, nourishes, and repairs damaged hair, reducing breakage. I prefer sulfate-free formulas and a gentle, non-stripping cleansing experience. I'm also on a budget, so I would like to find a shampoo that is affordable.

Based on your analysis, I have selected the following products that meet your criteria:

1.  **Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo**: This product targets damaged hair and helps repair up to 98% of daily breakage, making it a great fit for users needing intense nourishment and restoration. It's a sulfate-free formula that's gentle like a non-stripping cleansing experience.

3.  **Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Shampoo**: This product infuses hair with deep moisture and a coconut scent, offering a paraben-free, dermatologist-tested formula that's perfect for those seeking smooth, soft hair with tropical vibes.

Based on your budget, I would recommend the **Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Shampoo** as the most affordable option, priced at £4.99 for 400ml. It's a great value for the price, offering a sulfate-free, gentle, and non-stripping cleansing experience that's perfect for damaged hair. However, if you're willing to spend a bit more, the **Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo** is a great option, priced at £8.99 for 400ml.

I'm looking for a shampoo that will help repair and strengthen my damaged hair. Can you recommend some products that fit this need?

Here are my top 3 recommendations:

1. **Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo**: This shampoo is specifically designed to target damaged hair and help repair up to 98% of daily breakage. It's powered by Bio-Nourish Complex, which provides intense nourishment and restoration to your locks.
2. **The Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo**: This shampoo fortifies hair with apple extract and niacinamide, promoting moisture, smoothness, and detangling without parabens or phthalates. It's perfect for those aiming to resist breakage and enhance strength.
3. **Redken Color Extend Shampoo**: This shampoo is part of the Redken Color Extend line, which offers a range of products designed to nourish strands and protect color longevity. It's a great fit for anyone aiming to keep their dyed hair vibrant and healthy-looking.

All three of these shampoos are great options for repairing and strengthening damaged hair. However, if you're looking for a more intense repair solution, I would recommend the Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo. If you're looking for a more gentle, sulfate-free option, the Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo might be a better fit. And if you're looking for a shampoo that's specifically designed for color-treated hair, the Redken Color Extend Shampoo is a great choice.
