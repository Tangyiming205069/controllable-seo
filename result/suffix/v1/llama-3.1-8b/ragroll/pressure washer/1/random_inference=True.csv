I'd be happy to help you find the best pressure washer for your needs. Based on the products listed, I've ranked them according to your preferences (although you didn't specify any specific preferences). Here's a numbered list of the top 5 pressure washers:

1. **The Westinghouse WPX2700**: This gas-powered pressure washer is a top pick for its high 2700 PSI and 2.3 GPM flow rate, making it suitable for heavy-duty outdoor use and deep cleaning surfaces. Its 4 nozzle tips and 212cc OHV engine provide excellent performance and durability.
2. **The Generac 2900 PSI Gas Pressure Washer**: This gas-powered pressure washer is a close second, offering a 196cc OHV engine and an axial cam pump for reliable high-power cleaning. Its ergonomic spray gun and 25' hose make it easy to maneuver and clean a variety of outdoor surfaces.
3. **The Stanley FATMAX Gas Pressure Washer**: This gas-powered pressure washer is a great option for professionals seeking portable, durable pressure cleaning power. Its 149cc KOHLER engine and 12"" never-flat wheels make it easy to move around, and its 35' MorFlex hose provides excellent reach.
4. **The DEWALT DWPW2400**: This gas-powered pressure washer is a good choice for home and light commercial cleaning tasks. Its 2400 PSI and 1.1 GPM flow rate, combined with its onboard soap tank and kink-resistant hose, make it a reliable and efficient option.
5. **The Kärcher K5 Premium**: This electric pressure washer is a great option for homeowners looking for durable, quiet operation. Its 2000 PSI and 2.0 GPM flow rate, combined with its water-cooled induction motor and hose reel, make it a reliable and efficient choice.

The other products listed are not as highly ranked due to their lower PSI and GPM flow rates, or their specific design for lighter-duty cleaning tasks. The MTM Hydro PF22 Foam Cannon is not a pressure washer, but rather a high-performance foam cannon designed for car and surface cleaning. The Stihl RE 90 is a compact electric pressure washer, but its lower PSI and GPM flow rates make it less suitable for heavy-duty cleaning tasks.

I hope this helps you find the best pressure washer for your needs! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you",3
