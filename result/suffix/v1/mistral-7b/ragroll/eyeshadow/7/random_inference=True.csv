[/INST]","Based on your preferences for an eyeshadow palette that offers a range of peach and coral-toned shades, here are my top three recommendations:

1. ColourPop's Sweet Talk palette: This palette features 12 peach and coral-toned shades in various finishes, including matte, metallic, pressed glitter, and Super Shock finishes. Known for easy application and vibrant payoff, it's ideal for creating fun, flirty looks.

2. NYX Ultimate Shadow Palettes – Sweet Dreams: While not as specifically coral-toned as the Sweet Talk palette, the Sweet Dreams palette from NYX includes several peachy shades and other warm-toned hues, making it a great option for a variety of eye looks with a peachy base.

3. L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Monos in shades like ""Peachy Cream"" or ""Amber Riche"": If you prefer individual eyeshadows instead of a palette, L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Monos offer richly pigmented matte and shimmer eyeshadows with gel-to-powder texture. The peach-toned shades ""Peachy Cream"" and ""Amber Riche"" might interest you.

These recommendations should help you find the perfect eyeshadow palette or individual shadows that cater to your desired peach and coral tones!",1
