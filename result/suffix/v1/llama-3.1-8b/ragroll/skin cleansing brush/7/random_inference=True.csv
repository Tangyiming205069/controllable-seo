The other products you mentioned, such as The Shiseido Cleansing Massage Brush, The FOREO LUNA 3, The Vanity Planet Aira Facial Steamer, and The Braun FaceSpa 851V, are not included in the top three recommendations as they do not provide sonic-powered cleansing or have similar features to the top three products.
