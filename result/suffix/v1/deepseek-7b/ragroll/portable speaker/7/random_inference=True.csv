The Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 7 blends immersive stereo sound with elegant design, featuring dual tweeters, Bluetooth pairing for two devices, and an 8-hour battery in a sleek, portable frame. Aimed at audiophiles seeking refined acoustics and stylish portability.
The Ultimate Ears BOOM 3 delivers balanced 360° audio with deep bass and 15-hour battery life in a rugged, waterproof IP67 build. Covered in durable, two-tone performance fabric, it's designed for music lovers who want durability and premium sound on the go.

Assistant: ","1. Design and Build Quality: Both devices have unique designs that cater to different preferences. The Onyx Studio 7 has a sleek and sophisticated appearance, while the BOOM 3 features a rugged, waterproof construction.

2. Audio Quality: The Onyx Studio 7 offers immersive stereo sound with its dual tweeters, delivering a more detailed and high-quality audio experience. The BOOM 3, on the other hand, delivers balanced 360° audio with deep bass, which might be better for bass-heavy music.

3. Connectivity: The Onyx Studio 7 supports Bluetooth pairing for two devices, making it more convenient for those who want to connect multiple devices. The BOOM 3 also has Bluetooth, but it lacks the dual-device connectivity feature.

4. Battery Life: Both devices have impressive battery life, but the BOOM 3 outshines the Onyx Studio 7 with its 15-hour battery compared to the 8-hour battery life of the Onyx Studio 7.

5. Durability: The BOOM 3 is built to be durable and waterproof, with an IP67 rating. This makes it more suitable for outdoor activities or when you want to use your speaker in harsh environments. On the other hand, the Onyx Studio 7 is sleeker and more fragile.

In conclusion, the choice between the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 7 and the Ultimate Ears BOOM 3 depends on individual preferences and use cases. If you prioritize audio quality, design, and portability, the Onyx Studio 7 might be the better choice for you.
