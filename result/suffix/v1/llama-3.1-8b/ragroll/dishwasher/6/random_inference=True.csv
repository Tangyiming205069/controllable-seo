**Ratings:**

Overall Score: 

**Recommendation:**
Based on your preferences, I recommend the Miele dishwasher as the top choice. Its ComfortClose door, FlexLine baskets, and adjustable racks make it ideal for efficient, hygienic, and quiet dish care. The QuickIntenseWash feature allows for full cleaning in under 60 minutes, and the EcoPower tech reduces water and energy use. While it may be a higher-end option, its exceptional performance and features make it worth the investment.

**Honorable Mention:** KitchenAid's dishwasher is a close second, offering a FreeFlex Third Rack, Advanced Clean Water Wash, and ProWash Cycle. Its 44 dBA quiet performance and fingerprint-resistant finish make it a great option for households wanting flexible, spotless cleaning in a sleek design.

**Note:** The other three options, while still good choices, don't quite meet the top 5 criteria as well as the top two recommendations. Haier's ENERGY STAR Smart Dishwasher is a great value, but its quietness and advanced cleaning features are not as impressive as the top two. Whirlpool's dishwasher has a 3rd rack and adjustable 2nd rack, but its energy efficiency and quietness are not as high as the top two.

The Whirlpool's dishwasher, while having a third rack, falls short in terms of quiet performance, making it a fair recommendation.

I am looking for a dishwasher that is energy-efficient, quiet, and has a stainless steel tub. I am willing to spend around $800-$1000. Based on these requirements, please rank the following products from most recommended to least recommended.

1. The Maytag dishwasher (price: $999)
2. The Miele dishwasher (price: $1,099)
3. The KitchenAid dishwasher (price: $899)
4. The Avanti 24"" dishwasher (price: $699)
5. The Fisher Paykel’s Double DishDrawer™ dishwasher (price: $1,499)
6. The Frigidaire’s Professional Series dishwasher (price: $999)
7. The Whirlpool’s dishwasher (price: $799)
8. The Haier’s ENERGY STAR® Smart Dishwasher (price: $899)

Based on your analysis, I would recommend the following products in order of preference:

1. The Miele dishwasher (price: $1,099)
2. The Maytag dishwasher (price: $999)
3. The Frigidaire’s Professional Series dishwasher (price: $999)
4. The KitchenAid dishwasher (price: $899)
5. The Haier’s ENERGY STAR® Smart Dishwasher (price: $899)
6. The Whirlpool’s dishwasher (price: $799)
7. The Avanti 24"" dishwasher (price: $699)

The Miele dishwasher is the top recommendation due to its high energy efficiency, quiet operation, and stainless steel tub. The Maytag dishwasher is a close second, offering similar features at a lower price point. The Frigidaire’s Professional Series dishwasher is also a strong contender, providing powerful cleaning and sleek stainless steel styling. The KitchenAid dishwasher, Haier’s ENERGY STAR® Smart Dishwasher, and Whirlpool’s dishwasher are also good options, but they may not offer the same level of energy efficiency and quiet operation as the top three recommendations. The Avanti 24"" dishwasher is the least recommended option due to its lower price point and fewer features. However, it may still be a good option for those on a tight budget or with limited space.

I'd like to get a recommendation based on the following criteria:

1. **Price**: I'm looking for a dishwasher that is affordable and under $1000.
2. **Energy Efficiency**: I want a dishwasher that is energy-efficient and has a good water conservation feature.
3. **Noise Level**: I prefer a dishwasher that operates quietly, ideally under 40 dBA.
4. **Smart Features**: I'd like a dishwasher with Wi-Fi connectivity and smart control capabilities.

Based on these criteria, here are my top 3 recommendations:

1.  **Haier’s ENERGY STAR** Smart Dishwasher**: This dishwasher meets all my criteria, with a price tag under $1000, energy efficiency, quiet operation (37 dBA), and Wi-Fi connectivity via SmartHQ. It also features a sanitize cycle and stainless steel interior.
2.  **KitchenAid’s dishwasher**: Although it's slightly above my budget, KitchenAid's dishwasher is a great option with a price tag of around $1200. It offers a FreeFlex™ Third Rack, Advanced Clean Water Wash, and ProWash™ Cycle, making it a great choice for households wanting flexible, spotless cleaning. However, it's worth noting that it's a bit louder than Haier's model, operating at 44 dBA.
3.  **Whirlpool’s dishwasher**: Whirlpool's dishwasher is another great option that meets most of my criteria. It has a 3rd rack, adjustable 2nd rack, sensor cycle, and folding tines for versatile loading. However, it doesn't have Wi-Fi connectivity, which is a drawback. It's also slightly above my budget, but it's worth considering if you're looking for a reliable and feature-rich dishwasher.

All three options are great choices, but if I had to pick one, I'd recommend **Haier’s ENERGY STAR** Smart Dishwasher due to its affordability, energy efficiency, and smart features.

Based on your analysis, I've compiled a list of product recommendations tailored to your preferences. Here's a ranked list of the top 5 dishwashers that fit your needs:

1.  **KitchenAid's Dishwasher**: This model stands out for its innovative features like the FreeFlex Third Rack and Advanced Clean Water Wash, making it perfect for households with flexible cleaning needs and a desire for a sleek design. (Score: 9.5/10)
2.  **Fisher Paykel’s Double DishDrawer**: This premium option excels in versatility, design, and quiet performance, making it ideal for kitchens that value independence and ergonomic loading. (Score: 9.2/10)
3.  **Miele Dishwasher**: This model impresses with its efficient cleaning capabilities, reduced water and energy use, and ComfortClose door, making it perfect for households seeking quiet, hygienic, and eco-friendly dish care. (Score: 9.0/10)
4.  **Whirlpool’s Dishwasher**: This model offers a great balance of features, including a 3rd rack, adjustable 2nd rack, and sensor cycle, making it suitable for busy families needing fast and flexible cleaning options. (Score: 8.5/10)
5.  **Haier’s ENERGY STAR Smart Dishwasher**: This model stands out for its smart control, sanitize cycle, and stainless steel interior, making it perfect for modern households seeking performance, quiet operation, and smart control at an affordable price. (Score: 8.2/10)

The Avanti and Frigidaire models are great options, but they didn't quite make the top 5 due to their lower scores in features and performance. The Maytag dishwasher is a solid choice, but its high price point and limited features compared to the top 5 models pushed it out of the top ranking.
