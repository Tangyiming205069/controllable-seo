I'm looking for a leaf blower that is lightweight and has high airspeed. I'd like it to be cordless for convenience. Based on these preferences, here are my top recommendations:

1.  **The BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Sweeper**: This blower is extremely lightweight at 3.7 lbs and delivers high airspeed of up to 130 MPH. It's also cordless, making it perfect for quick yard touch-ups and cleaning hard surfaces.
2.  **The RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Blower**: This blower weighs only 4.5 lbs and delivers 200 CFM at 90 MPH. It's optimized for hard surfaces and is great for quick, maneuverable cleanup tasks.
3.  **The Makita cordless blower**: While not the lightest option, this blower is still relatively lightweight at 9 lbs with batteries and delivers high airspeed of 120 MPH. It's also quiet and perfect for quiet, powerful yard cleanup.

These three blowers meet your requirements of being lightweight and cordless, with high airspeed. However, if you prioritize the lightest option, the BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Sweeper would be the best choice. If you prefer a bit more power, the Makita cordless blower would be a good option. If you're looking for a balance between weight and power, the RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Blower would be a great choice.

I am looking for a leaf blower that is quiet, powerful, and lightweight. I have a large yard and would like to use it for year-round cleanups. I am willing to spend more money on a high-quality product.

Based on your analysis, I recommend the following products in order of priority:

1. **The Makita cordless blower**: This product delivers 120 MPH and 473 CFM using two 18V LXT batteries with a brushless motor and 6-stage air volume dial. Weighing 9 lbs with batteries and emitting just 61 dB(A), it’s perfect for quiet, powerful yard cleanup.

I recommend the Makita cordless blower as the top choice due to its quiet operation, powerful performance, and lightweight design. However, if you prefer a backpack blower, the Poulan Pro PR48BT is a close second. The WORX TURBINE electric blower is also a good option, but it may not be as powerful as the top two choices. The STIHL BR 800 X MAGNUM backpack blower is a high-end option, but it may be overkill for a residential yard. [/INST] <<SYS>> [/INST] <<USR>>",9

I am looking for a leaf blower that is powerful, efficient, and comfortable to use. Based on the products listed, I would like to rank them according to the following criteria:

1. Power (CFM and MPH)
2. Ergonomics and comfort
3. Ease of use (start-up, speed control, and maintenance)
4. Weight and portability

Here are my ranked product recommendations:

1.  **STIHL BR 800 X MAGNUM backpack blower**: This blower excels in all four criteria. Its 4.4 hp engine delivers an impressive 725 CFM and 170 MPH, making it the most powerful option. The anti-vibration system and ergonomic harness ensure pro-grade comfort, while the tool-free adjustments and 4-MIX engine make it easy to use and maintain. At 21.3 lbs, it's a bit heavier, but its performance and features justify the weight.
2.  **Poulan Pro PR48BT backpack blower**: This blower is a close second, offering 475 CFM and 200 MPH. Its cruise control and ergonomic harness make it comfortable to use, and the soft-grip handles provide a secure grip. While it's a bit heavier than the STIHL (24.3 lbs), its performance and features make it a top contender.
3.  **Husqvarna 125B handheld blower**: This blower is a solid choice, offering 470 CFM and 170 MPH. Its air purge and multi-speed control make it easy to use, and the ergonomic design ensures comfort. However, its weight (9.4 lbs) is a drawback, making it less portable than the top two options.
4.  **WORX TURBINE electric blower**: This blower is a great option for those who prioritize ease of use and weight. Its turbine fan tech and variable speed control make it efficient and easy to use, and it's relatively lightweight (6.4 lbs). However, its power (600 CFM and 110 MPH) is lower than the top three options.
5.  **DeWalt 20V MAX Brushless Handheld Blower**: This blower is a good choice for those who prioritize portability and ease of use. Its lightweight design (4.5 lbs) and variable speed trigger make it easy to maneuver, but its power (450 CFM and 125 MPH",9

- For MPH, I will use a linear scale where 0-80 MPH = 1 point, 81-120 MPH = 3 points, 121-160 MPH = 5 points, and 161 MPH and above = 7 points.
- The total power score will be the sum of the CFM and MPH scores.

**Weight Score:**
- I will use a linear scale where 0-5 lbs = 1 point, 5.1-10 lbs = 2 points, 10.1-15 lbs = 3 points, and 15.1 lbs and above = 4 points.

**Overall Score:**
