1. MSI Optix MAG274QRF-QD - This monitor offers a balance of excellent gaming features, including 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms GTG response, Quantum Dot color, and G-Sync compatibility, with a WQHD resolution that can also serve well for productivity purposes. Its features like Rapid IPS, HDR, USB-C, and Mystic Light add to its attractiveness.

Its 1ms GTG response time and NVIDIA G-SYNC technology make it ideal for competitive gaming, but its FHD resolution and Fast IPS tech can still be valuable for productivity tasks, particularly for editing images and videos.

3. LG UltraGear 27GN750 - This monitor has a 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms IPS response, and G-Sync compatibility, making it perfect for fast-paced gameplay. Although it has an FHD resolution, its 99% sRGB color gamut is ideal for color-correct work and can handle light graphic design tasks.

4. AOC C32G2E - A curved gaming monitor with a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and AMD FreeSync. It features a frameless design, low input lag mode, and game-specific presets, making it great for immersive and competitive gaming. However, its 32"" size and WQHD resolution may be too large for a solely productivity-focused workspace.

5. Acer Nitro XV272U RV - With a 95% DCI-P3 color gamut, 170Hz refresh rate, and 1ms response time, this monitor is great for gamers who seek color accuracy and fluid motion. Its ergonomic flexibility may appeal to productivity users as well, but its WQHD resolution might be more than what's needed for a purely productivity setup.
