I am looking for a microwave oven that has a compact design and quiet operation. I am also interested in a model with WiFi connectivity for remote monitoring and control. Can you recommend some products based on these requirements?

[INST] <<SYS>>
Based on your requirements, I recommend the following microwave ovens:

1. **The Breville Compact Wave Soft Close** (Product 1): This microwave oven has a compact design and is 80% quieter than traditional microwaves, making it perfect for quiet, intuitive kitchen use. However, it does not have WiFi connectivity.
2. **The GE HMC920BEWW** (Product 4): This microwave oven is compact and tech-enabled, with built-in WiFi powered by SmartHQ, offering real-time performance feedback and remote control. It's a great option for small kitchens with smart home integration.
3. **The LG NeoChef** (Product 6): While not as compact as the first two options, the LG NeoChef has WiFi connectivity through its Smart Inverter tech, allowing for remote monitoring and control. It also features a 6-wheel stabilizer ring for balance and EasyClean for easy cleaning.

These three options meet your requirements for compact design, quiet operation, and WiFi connectivity. However, if you prioritize WiFi connectivity and smart home integration, the GE HMC920BEWW might be the best choice. If you prefer a more compact design and are willing to sacrifice WiFi connectivity, the Breville Compact Wave Soft Close could be the best option. The LG NeoChef offers a balance between compactness and WiFi connectivity, but it's not as compact as the first two options. [/INST] <<USR>>

3. Aesthetically pleasing design (modern, sleek, or unique)

Based on these assumptions, here's a ranked list of product recommendations:

2. **LG NeoChef**: Although not explicitly mentioned as compact, the NeoChef features a 6-wheel stabilizer ring for balance and EasyClean, making it a great choice for users who prioritize ease of use and cleaning.
3. **Panasonic NN-SN966SR**: This microwave offers advanced features like Inverter Technology and Genius Sensor cooking, but its larger size (2.2 cu. ft.) might not be suitable for users with limited space.
4. **Sharp SMC1452CH**: While this microwave features a sleek design and powerful performance, its size (1.4 cu. ft.) might be too large for users with compact kitchens.
5. **Toshiba**: This microwave has a modern design and features like express and defrost functions, but its size (not specified) and lack of advanced technology might not meet the user's preferences.
