Based on your request for a tablet for schooling with a casual display, lowest clear-quality image, and a user-friendly experience, I recommend the following top 3 products:

1.  **Alcatel 3T10 (2020)**: This tablet offers a 10-inch display with an 80% screen-to-body ratio, making it a great option for casual use. Its Kids Mode and Eye Care viewing features ensure a safe and comfortable viewing experience for children. The 5500mAh battery provides long-lasting power, and its 4G LTE connectivity keeps you connected.
2.  **LG G Pad IV 8.0 FHD**: This tablet features an 8-inch Full HD display, which may not be the highest resolution, but it's still suitable for casual use. Its expandable 32GB storage and dual cameras make it a great option for everyday productivity and entertainment. The Comfort View mode and Microsoft Office pre-installed ensure a user-friendly experience.
3.  **Acer Iconia Tab P10**: While it has a higher-resolution 2K display, it's still a great option for those who want a user-friendly experience. Its Google Kids Space feature makes it suitable for family entertainment and portable productivity. The MediaTek Kompanio 500 processor provides smooth performance, and the up to 10.5-hour battery life ensures you can use it throughout the day.

These recommendations prioritize a casual display, lowest clear-quality image, and user-friendly experience, making them suitable for schooling purposes. However, if you're looking for a more premium experience, the Apple iPad mini (6th Gen) or the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE might be worth considering.
