1. LatteArt Pro - This machine fits your preference perfectly as it features a built-in milk frother, temperature control, and the pouring arm is stir-able. It has a rating of 4.6 stars and is priced at $599.

2. Cappuccino King - While it does not have a built-in milk frother, this machine still produces professional-quality cappuccinos, and you can purchase a separate milk frother if needed. It also has temperature control, and the price is $799.

3. LatteArt Pro and Grind&Brew Plus (tie) - Both of these machines have built-in milk frothers, temperature control, and the ability to grind coffee beans for a fresh brew. The difference between the two is that the LatteArt Pro has the pouring arm that is stir-able while the Grind&Brew Plus does not. However, you might prefer the Grind&Brew Plus if you value an integrated grinder more than a stir-able arm. The LatteArt Pro is priced at $599, and Grind&Brew Plus is $349.

Alternatively, if you're looking for a more budget-friendly option with similar features, the SingleServe Wonder can be a decent choice, although it might not have temperature control and stir functionality. It's priced at $59 and features a single-serve coffee pod system with quick brewing. Keep in mind that it does not offer the same level of control over brewing variables compared to the top three recommended machines.",1
