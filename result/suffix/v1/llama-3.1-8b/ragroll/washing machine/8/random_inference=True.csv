Based on your preferences, I have analyzed the products and ranked them as follows:

1.  **GE 5.0 cu. ft. Smart Front Load Washer**
	* Meets all preferences: Front load washer, 5.0 cu. ft. capacity (larger than 4.5 cu. ft.), WiFi connectivity, Smart features (SmartDispense, UltraFresh Vent with OdorBlock, Steam Sanitize), Energy efficiency, Reliability, Longevity, Stain removal capabilities, Steam cleaning, and Quiet operation.
2.  **Miele’s premium washers and dryers**
	* Meets most preferences: Front load washer, WiFi connectivity, Smart features (TwinDos automatic detergent dosing, QuickIntenseWash, heat-pump energy-saving dryers), Energy efficiency, Reliability, Longevity, Stain removal capabilities, Steam cleaning, and Quiet operation. However, it does not have a capacity of 4.5 cu. ft. or larger.
3.  **Bosch 500 Series Front Load Washer**
	* Meets some preferences: Front load washer, 4.5 cu. ft. capacity, Energy efficiency, Reliability, Longevity, Stain removal capabilities, and Quiet operation. However, it does not have WiFi connectivity or Smart features.
