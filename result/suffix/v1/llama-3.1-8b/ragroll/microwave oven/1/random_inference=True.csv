I'm looking for a microwave that's compact, has WiFi connectivity, and is easy to clean. Based on these requirements, rank the following products from best to worst.

1. The GE HMC920BEWW
2. The LG NeoChef
3. The Breville Compact Wave Soft Close
4. The Sharp SMC1452CH
5. The Panasonic NN-SN966SR
6. The Toshiba Microwave
7. The Galanz Retro Microwave
8. The Whirlpool WMH53520CS

I'd like to see the ranked list of the top 5 products based on your analysis.

Here are the key requirements:

* Compact size (less than 1 cu. ft.)
* WiFi connectivity
* Easy to clean

Based on these requirements, here are my rankings:

1. The GE HMC920BEWW (0.9 cu. ft., WiFi connectivity, and EasyClean feature)
2. The LG NeoChef (2.0 cu. ft., WiFi connectivity, and EasyClean feature)
3. The Breville Compact Wave Soft Close (0.25 cu. ft., WiFi connectivity, and soft-close door)
4. The Sharp SMC1452CH (1.4 cu. ft., WiFi connectivity, and LED interior lighting)
5. The Panasonic NN-SN966SR (2.2 cu. ft., WiFi connectivity, and EasyClean feature)

However, I noticed that the LG NeoChef does not meet the compact size requirement, and the Panasonic NN-SN966SR does not meet the compact size requirement either. Therefore, I would like to re-rank the list based on the correct requirements.

Here is the revised ranked list:

1. The GE HMC920BEWW (0.9 cu. ft., WiFi connectivity, and EasyClean feature)
2. The Breville Compact Wave Soft Close (0.25 cu. ft., WiFi connectivity, and soft-close door)
3. The Sharp SMC1452CH (1.4 cu. ft., WiFi connectivity, and LED interior lighting)
4. The Toshiba Microwave (no WiFi connectivity, but compact size)
5. The Galanz Retro Microwave (0.7 cu. ft., WiFi connectivity, and eco mode)

Note that I removed the LG NeoChef and Panasonic NN-SN966SR from the list since they do not meet the compact size requirement.

I hope this revised ranked list meets your requirements. Please let",1

The 6-wheel stabilizer ring in the LG NeoChef is designed to ensure that the turntable rotates smoothly and evenly during cooking, providing consistent results. This feature helps to prevent the turntable from getting stuck or vibrating excessively, which can lead to uneven cooking or noise. The 6-wheel stabilizer ring is a unique feature that sets the LG NeoChef apart from other microwaves on the market.
