I am looking for a shampoo that can help with hair breakage. I want a product that is gentle and suitable for all hair types. I also want a product that is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens and phthalates.

Based on your requirements, I recommend the following products in order of ranking:

1.  **Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo**: This shampoo is specifically designed to help fortify hair and prevent breakage. It contains apple extract and niacinamide, which work together to provide moisture, smoothness, and detangling without weighing hair down. It's also free from parabens and phthalates, making it a great choice for those with sensitive scalps or hair.
2.  **Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo**: This shampoo is designed to provide long-lasting moisture without weighing hair down. It's gentle enough for daily use and is free from harsh chemicals like parabens and phthalates. It's also suitable for all hair types, making it a great all-around choice.
3.  **L'Oréal EverPure Sulfate-Free Moisture Shampoo**: This shampoo is designed to deeply hydrate dry, color-treated hair while also providing up to 4 weeks of color protection. It's free from harsh chemicals like parabens and phthalates, and is also sulfate-free, making it a great choice for those with sensitive scalps or hair.
4.  **Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Shampoo**: This shampoo is designed to provide deep moisture and hydration to dry hair. It's free from parabens and is also dermatologist-tested, making it a great choice for those with sensitive scalps or hair. However, it may not be as effective at preventing breakage as the top three options.
5.  **The Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo**: This shampoo is designed to cleanse and refresh the hair and scalp with natural tea tree oil, peppermint, and lavender. While it's free from harsh chemicals like parabens and phthalates, it may not provide the same level of moisture and hydration as the top four options.

Based on your requirements, I ranked the Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo as the top recommendation, followed closely by the Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo. Both of these shampoos are gentle, free from harsh chemicals, and suitable for all hair types. However",1

Based on the user's request, I have compiled a list of product recommendations ranked according to their preferences. Here's the top 5 list:

1. **Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Shampoo**: This shampoo is perfect for those seeking a moisturizing formula that's paraben-free and dermatologist-tested. Its coconut scent and deep moisture benefits make it ideal for users with dry or damaged hair.
2. **L'Oréal EverPure Sulfate-Free Moisture Shampoo**: This sulfate-free shampoo is designed for dry, color-treated hair and provides 2X more moisture and up to 4 weeks of color protection. It's a great fit for users seeking gentle, hydrating cleansing.

The other products, while excellent in their own right, didn't quite fit the user's request as well as these top 5 recommendations. The Redken Color Extend line is a great product, but it wasn't mentioned in the user's request, so I didn't include it in the top 5 list. The Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo is a great product for strengthening hair, but it's not as focused on moisturizing or color protection as the top 5 recommendations. The Matrix Brass Off Shampoo is a great product for neutralizing brassy tones, but it's not as focused on moisturizing or color protection as the top 5 recommendations. The Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo is already included in the top 5 list, so I didn't include it again. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. <<SYS>>[INST] <<SYS>>

Based on the user's request, I will rank the shampoo products according to their suitability for the user's needs. Since the user did not specify any particular preference, I will assume they are looking for a general-purpose shampoo that is gentle, moisturizing, and suitable for most hair types.

Here is the ranked list:

To provide you with the most relevant recommendations, I'll rank the products based on your preferences. Since you didn't specify any particular hair type, color, or concern, I'll assume you're looking for a general-purpose shampoo. Here's a ranked list of the products:

1. **Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo**: This shampoo is a great all-around choice, offering gentle, sulfate-free cleansing and locking in moisture without weighing hair down.
2. **Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo**: As a starter product, this shampoo is perfect for those aiming to fortify their hair with apple extract and niacinamide, promoting moisture, smoothness, and detangling.
3. **Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Shampoo**: This shampoo infuses hair with deep moisture and a coconut scent, making it a great choice for those seeking smooth, soft hair with a tropical vibe.
4. **Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo**: While it's a great option for damaged hair, it might be too intense for those with normal or fine hair. However, it's a great choice for those needing intense nourishment and restoration.
5. **Matrix Brass Off Shampoo**: This shampoo is specifically designed for brunettes who lighten their hair and want cooler, refreshed tones. If you don't have this specific hair concern, it might not be the best choice.
6. **The Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo**: While it's a great option for those seeking a vegan, paraben-free, color-safe refresh, it might be too harsh for those with sensitive scalps.
7. **L'Oréal EverPure Sulfate-Free Moisture Shampoo**: This shampoo is a great choice for those seeking sulfate-free, gentle cleansing, but it might not be as effective for those with very dry or damaged hair.
8. **The Redken Color Extend line**: While it's a great option for those aiming to keep their dyed hair vibrant and healthy-looking, it's a more premium product with a higher price point.
