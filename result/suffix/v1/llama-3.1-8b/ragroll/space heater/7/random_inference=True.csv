I want a space heater that is safe and has a long-lasting battery life. I also want it to be portable and compact. Based on these requirements, I would like to prioritize the following features:

1. Safety features (e.g. tip-over protection, overheat protection)
2. Compact size and portability
3. Long-lasting battery life
4. Efficient heating

Rank the products according to my preferences and provide a numbered list of the top 3 recommendations.

Based on your requirements, I've ranked the products according to your preferences. Here's the list of top 3 recommendations:

1. **The Honeywell 360° Surround Heater**
	* Safety features: 360° tip-over safety, overheat protection
	* Compact size and portability: Compact design, lightweight, and easy to move
	* Long-lasting battery life: Not applicable (it's a plug-in heater)
	* Efficient heating: Dual heat settings for optimal warmth
2. **The Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater**
	* Safety features: 7-foot cord rewind, tip-over safety, and overheat protection
	* Compact size and portability: Compact design, lightweight, and easy to move
	* Long-lasting battery life: Not applicable (it's a plug-in heater)
	* Efficient heating: Widespread oscillation and elongated heating element for efficient heat distribution
3. **The Dreo Portable Space Heater**
	* Safety features: Tip-over protection, overheat protection, and child safety lock
	* Compact size and portability: Extremely compact and lightweight, making it easy to move and store
	* Long-lasting battery life: Not applicable (it's a plug-in heater)
	* Efficient heating: 1500W PTC ceramic heating and 65° oscillation for efficient heat distribution

Note that none of the products have a long-lasting battery life, as they are all plug-in heaters. However, the Dreo Portable Space Heater is the most compact and portable option, making it a great choice if you need a space heater that can be easily moved around. [INST] <<USR>> I see that none of the products have a long-lasting battery life. Can you recommend a portable power bank to pair with one of the space heaters? I'd like a power bank that has a long-lasting battery life and is compact and lightweight. [INST] <<SYS>>

Based on the provided products, I will rank the top 5 space heaters according to their features and user ratings. Here is the list:

1. **Dreo Portable Space Heater**: This product stands out for its efficiency, quiet operation (40dB), and fast heating (3 seconds). It also features a 65° oscillation and remote control, making it an excellent choice for home heating.
2. **Dr. Infrared Heater DR-968**: With its powerful infrared quartz and PTC heating, this product delivers 60% more heat and operates at an ultra-quiet 39dB. It also features comprehensive safety features, making it ideal for large rooms.
3. **Heat Storm Tradesman 1500W Infrared Heater**: This product is perfect for garages, workshops, and patios due to its weatherproof design, silent operation, and adjustable tripod. It's also portable and wind-resistant.
4. **The De’Longhi TRRS0715E Radiant Heater**: This product features a digital LED panel, ECO function, and 24-hour timer, making it a convenient choice for users. It also delivers 1500W of quiet, allergy-friendly heat with up to 35% more radiant surface.
5. **Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater**: This product offers widespread oscillation, an elongated heating element, and programmable thermostat, making it a safe and efficient choice for home heating. However, it ranks lower due to its slightly lower user ratings compared to the top 4 products.

The other products, while featuring interesting features, were ranked lower due to various factors such as lower user ratings or fewer features. The Honeywell 360° Surround Heater is a reliable choice for small to mid-sized room heating, but it ranks lower due to its fewer features compared to the top 5 products. The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde is a high-end product that combines air purification and heating, but its price and complexity make it less suitable for a basic space heater recommendation. The Pelonis 1500W Electric Oil Radiator Heater and The Heat Storm Tradesman 1500W Infrared Heater are both good options, but they rank lower due to their fewer features and lower user ratings.

2. **The De’Longhi TRRS0715E Radiant Heater**: With its digital LED panel, ECO function, and 24-hour timer, this product offers a high level of comfort and energy efficiency. Its allergy-friendly heat and quiet operation make it an excellent choice.
3. **The Pelonis 1500W Electric Oil Radiator Heater**: This product's adjustable thermostat, five heat settings, and 10-hour programmable timer make it a great option for users seeking efficient and customizable heat. Its remote control feature is also a plus.
4. **The Honeywell 360° Surround Heater**: With its all-around warmth, 360° tip-over safety, and dual heat settings, this product is a reliable choice for small to mid-sized room heating. Its enhanced safety features are a significant advantage.
5. **The Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater**: This product's widespread oscillation, programmable thermostat, and seven-hour timer make it a good option for safe and efficient heating. However, its design may not be as compact as some other products.
6. **The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde**: While this product excels at air quality and purification, its primary function is not heating. It may be overkill for users only seeking a space heater.
7. **The Dr. Infrared Heater DR-968**: Although it offers infrared quartz and PTC heating, this product's 60% more heat claim may not be as significant as other features. Its ultra-quiet operation is a plus, but its design may not be as sleek as some other products.
8. **The Heat Storm Tradesman 1500W Infrared Heater**: This product's weatherproof design and adjustable tripod make it suitable for outdoor use, but its lack of remote control and less efficient heating may make it a less desirable option for indoor use.

Based on your request for a small, affordable, and compact space heater with good quality, low aesthetic appeal, and a durable design that comes with a warranty, I've ranked the following products:

1. **Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater**: This compact space heater is a great value for its price, offering widespread oscillation, a programmable thermostat, and a seven-hour timer. It's also affordable and comes with a one-year warranty. (Score: 9/10)
2. **Pelonis 1500W Electric Oil Radiator Heater**: This space heater is another affordable option that offers adjustable thermostat, five heat settings, and a 10-hour programmable timer. It's also compact and has a low-profile design. (Score: 8.5/10)
3. **The Heat Storm Tradesman 1500W Infrared Heater**: This infrared heater is a great choice for those who need a compact and portable space heater. It's also durable and comes with a 3-year warranty. However, it's a bit pricier than the other two options. (Score: 8/10)

I've excluded the other products from the list as they either don't meet the ""small and affordable"" criteria or have higher price points. The Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater is my top recommendation due to its excellent value, compact design, and feature-rich functionality. However, if you're looking for a more traditional radiator-style heater, the Pelonis 1500W Electric Oil Radiator Heater is a great alternative.
